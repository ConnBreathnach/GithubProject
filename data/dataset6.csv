17,tensorflow/tensorflow,Kh4L,[TF-TRT] Add Layout + ConstFold optimization on the TRT engine op,"### Motivation
The introduction of Tensor Cores in recent GPU architectures (and the subsequent changes in cuDNN) made `NHWC` the preferred layout for convolutions in TF.

However, the TensorRT API requires the input for convolution to be in `NCHW`. To satisfy this requirement, TF-TRT was inserting transpose ops around convolutions when necessary.

This PR adds a layout optimization pass with a target layout of `NCHW`, which ensures that most of Conv kernels will be in TRT compatible layout. Additionally, the layout optimization pass can eliminate redundant layout transpose operations. This results in a simpler TRT network with a larger potential for optimization.

### Description
TF-TRT now accomplishes it by running both a grapplers's `GenericLayoutOptimizer` followed by a ConstantFolding optimizers  in the `ConvertGraphDefToEngine`, applying them on a segment level.

The LayoutOptimizer ensures that the number of transposition is optimal. This optimization is described in slides 18-21 of [TensorFlow Graph Optimizations presentation ](LINK

This PR also modifies the `GenericLayoutOptimizer` to enforce a specific layout is set as layout target, through a ctor parameter.",1

The Eigen commit changes the visibility of the `Packet` type ( `Packet4h2`) for the `Eigen::half` datatype. Prior to the commit, `Packet` type is defined as `Packet4h2` during both the `host` and `device` compile phases of hipcc/nvcc. After the commit the `Packet` type is defined as `Eigen::half` (size == 2) in the `host` compile phase, and as `Packet4h2` (size == 8) in the device compile phase.

`struct AvgPoolMeanReducer` has a member of type `Packet`(LINK and hence its size will be different during the `host` compile phase and `device` compile phase. It also seems that the implementation of the `average pooling` op ( LINK ) will result in a `struct AvgPoolMeanReducer` argument being passed across the `host` / `device` compile boundary (atleast for `hipcc`) and size mismatch between the two, leads to the subsequent segfault.

The fix here is to ensure the `Packet` has the same definitition for both the `host` and `device` compile phases. However changing the type `packetCount_` to `int` unconditionally leads to compile errors, because during the non-gpu / gcc compiles the code within the `!defined(__HIPCC__)` block gets activated, and hence the changes in this commit are guarded by `defined(__HIPCC__)`. Using `int` for `packetCount_` is ok because `PacketAcces`s is already set to `false` within (a different) `defined(__HIPCC__)` block.

This mitigates one of the problems seen in LINK and makes that BERT Large model (and others) convert successfully.

- In the previous set of optimizers, `constfold` was duplicating constants unnecessarily due to some control dependencies. `dependency` and `common_subgraph_elimination` do a great job at removing this duplication.
- I also noticed that having a `constfold` before _and_ after `layout` was unnecessary, and in all the models I've tested, equivalent to just having the second one.

I haven't measured any significant performance impact but the size of converted transformer models tends to be reduced by 50% with this change.

_Note: I had to change the tests slightly because the dependency optimizer removes the `ReadVariableOp` and keeps a constant `v1` whereas constant folding alone optimizes `ReadVariableOp` to a constant with the value of `v1`. This  also depends on the order of the Grappler passes.",2

2. Modified the implementation of the moving of single-block regions
such that it uses the `mergeBlocks()` function instead of the original
`cloneRegionBefore()` function. This was done because the latter has a
non-trivial cost and could be dropped due to the currently specific
requirement of moving (not cloning) single-block regions in the
`convert-tf-control-flow-to-scf` pass.

@bixia1 for review

CC: @tfeher @DEKHTIARJonathan

- Adds functionality to allow saving and loading of calibration tables via asset files
  - It is implemented by attaching the calibrator to the engine cache, so that the calibrator is loaded in during inference time inside the `TRTEngineCacheResource` object.
  - After calibration, each `TRTEngineOp` has its calibration table saved to its own asset file
- Removes the previous code for saving and loading of calibration tables via attributes
- Currently, calibration tables are saved using attributes which means that the calibration tables count towards the 2GB ProtoBuf size limit. By migrating to asset files, the tables no longer count towards the 2GB limit and can be as large as necessary.

Instead, API users are expected to use `delete` or standard managed pointers after receiving a pointer to an API object created by TensorRT. This change is applied to the `TrtUniquePtr` type used through TF-TRT.",1
68,tensorflow/tensorflow,Nyrio,[TF-TRT] Provide a way to use different Grappler optimizers for the function library than the main graph,"This is a POC that probably needs some refining. During TF-TRT conversion, we need to turn on different optimizers during optimization of the main graph and `TRTEngine` functions. Since other functions are inlined, it is effectively equivalent to using different optimizers for the function library.

### How it works

- Add fields to `RewriterConfig` to specify an alternate list of optimizers and custom optimizers, along with a boolean to toggle the use of these alternate lists. The default behavior doesn't change (i.e same optimizers for the main graph and function library)
- Add an optional parameter to `MetaOptimizer::OptimizeGraph()` and helper functions to know whether the main graph or function library is being optimized, and set this parameter when optimizing the function library in `MetaOptimizer::OptimizeConsumeItem()`.
- When optimizing the function library, get the optimizer list from these new fields if the boolean is true.

### Example of TRT conversion logs (BERT Base)

  constant_folding: Graph size after: 2884 nodes (-409), 3897 edges (-410), time = 2186.9751ms.

A few tries confirmed me that relying on `border-width` as in v4 doesn't imply any side effect, even when using the (deprecated) `size` attribute.

I don't see any reason to stick with `height` then, so ditching this to make our new `hr` closer to v4.

Contrary to what we said in #34574, we can keep the opacity feature this way. With my current proposal, customizing `hr` could be done using `.text-*` for color and `.border-*` for sizing. I'd stick to `currentColor` for color since it allows inheritance: relying on `border-color` would require us to define a value (as it was done in v4) but I think it's more valuable to inherit from text color, isn't it?

221,twbs/bootstrap,ffoodd,[WIP]: using fallback values insteead of explicit declarations,"Only a POC to check if using fallback values instead of explicit custom properties declarations could save bytes.

The rationale to switch to fallback values or not is the number of occurrences: (`, ` + value) √ó n occurrences should be longer than the whole explicit declaration. I did not count it for now but that should IMHO be the decision tree.

The only exception would be `font-size`s since RFS could behave differently depending on the value. Using its output as a fallback isn't safe.

- Top-level dropdowns can be navigated through with the left and right arrows or tab keys.
- Top-level dropdowns are opened with spacebar, down arrow, or enter key. First item in dropdown is selected automatically.
- Dropdowns can be navigated with up and down arrows or tab key and selection wraps from beginning to end / end to beginning.
- Sub-dropdowns can be opened with right arrow, spacebar, or enter key. First item in sub-dropdown is selected automatically.
- Dropdowns and sub-dropdowns can be closed with the left arrow or escape key. Only the currently open dropdown or sub-dropdown will close (will not bubble up to all parents and close everything). The item that opened that dropdown is selected automatically.
- Dropdown and sub-dropdown links can be opened with spacebar or enter key and closes entire menubar.
- Only one dropdown can be open at a time in a menubar.
- Fixed a bug where the spacebar didn't open dropdown items (dropdown.js line 39).

249,twbs/bootstrap,mdo,Convert pagination component to CSS variables,"This PR represents a potential shift in how we're using CSS variables for our components. In previous cases like #34600, I've been creating new CSS variables for each state-property pairing (e.g., `--bs-btn-color`, `--bs-btn-hover-color`, and `--bs-btn-active-color`). This matches our Sass-based customization of variables for almost every property and state, but it does create bloat in the component base class.

In contrast, this PR only sets the essential variables on the base class and uses CSS variable reassignment as needed to modify those properties for each state with their Sass variables. For example, `--bs-pagination-color` is set on `.pagination` and then overridden on `.page-link:hover` using the same `--bs-pagination-color` variable with a new value.

I think this approach makes more sense and can steer us toward more CSS variable re-use (e.g., `--bs-pagination-bg: var(--bs-body-bg)`), steering us away from too much Sass variable re-use that led to complicated customization issues.

250,twbs/bootstrap,julien-deramond,Remove extra spaces between navbar brand image and text,"While working with navbars, I've spotted something that I think is not here on purpose.

Indeed, this is the line break in the source code that adds a space between the image and the text.

<img width=""543"" alt=""Capture d‚ÄôeÃÅcran 2021-11-25 aÃÄ 16 12 19"" src=""LINK

If we remove this line break, the string doesn't have anymore those extra spaces and becomes right next to the image:
<img width=""588"" alt=""Capture d‚ÄôeÃÅcran 2021-11-25 aÃÄ 16 12 44"" src=""LINK

This PR is a proposal to align all the content of the `<a>` and to handle the spacing with a `.me-1` ([see it in action here](LINK

Another technique would be to do something like that whose I'm not a big fan of:

```html
<a class=""navbar-brand"" href=""#"">
  <img src=""/docs/{{< param docs_version >}}/assets/brand/bootstrap-logo.svg"" alt="""" width=""30"" height=""24"" class=""d-inline-block align-text-top me-1""><!--
  -->Bootstrap<!--

## Context

Tried it first in [this PR in my forked version of Bootstrap](LINK among other things ‚Äî All check have passed.
There are still several TODO topics to tackle in LINK
The target of this PR would be `main-xmr-pa11y-ci`.

I chose here to focus on having a green pa11y-ci job by hiding all elements reported as issues; it would help us to track the new issues that will be merged into `main` while trying to fix the current ones.
Indeed, `pa11y-ci` is a bit unstable at the moment and it becomes easier to check regression if you know that the job can be green (everything is OK) instead of having to analyze the red one that can be a regression or a crash...

I was thinking of the following process:

## Fix existing issues
1. **Done here** Hide all the errors reported by pa11y-ci to have a green job.
2. For each `hideElements` rule, analyze it, define if it is a real issue and fill the table below with the analysis in the last column.
3. If the issue can be fixed, open a PR and write its reference in the table below.
4. When the issue is fixed / merged, remove the `hideElements` rule.

## Handle new issues
After each rebase of the `main-xmr-pa11y-ci`, the pa11y-ci job would be executed by GitHub CI. If we observe new issues in the artifact: we should write a new `hideElements` rule and add a new line in the table below.

## Pa11y issues tracker

Total without any `hideElements`: **568 errors**

**Legend**
* :stop_button: Analysis must be done
* :hourglass: Work In Progress ‚Äî A PR is probably being reviewed
* :white_check_mark: Analysis done ‚Äî Keep the `hideElements` rule
* :heavy_check_mark: Analysis done ‚Äî Removed the `hideElements` rule

### Missing submit button in Algolia search form

|  | :white_check_mark:   |
|---|---|
| **Error** | `This form does not contain a submit button, which creates issues for those who cannot submit the form using the keyboard. Submit buttons are INPUT elements with type attribute ""submit"" or ""image"", or BUTTON elements with type ""submit"" or omitted/invalid` |

[Eclipse's documentation](LINK confusingly recommends `.classpath` and `.project` being under version control. That recommendation makes sense if neither maven or gradle is used. 

However, when using either maven or gradle those files are generated each time based on the maven or gradle configuration - which causes issues when those files are version controlled. That is why I recommended ignoring these files _only_ if using maven or gradle, but _not_ for all Eclipse Java projects.

If a user has ignored an asset (no matter how dubious that decision may be), they also want to ignore the .meta file. Instead of bringing back .metas that have been ignored, this template should trust that a user has ignored the files they want to ignore.

You'd encounter this issue if you had added an ignore for an asset and its meta above this Unity template, or if another template ignored an asset and meta.

In general excludes may be dangerous in these templates, as they can have unintended consequences on other templates.

The onus should be on anyone storing credentials in this file to manually add it to .gitignore.

In the notebook, you it is been written that ""From classes we can construct instances. An instance is a specific object created from a particular class.""

This implies that objects are instances of class. Therefore,
lst = [1,2,3] (example in the Note Book) is an object and is the object of class list

so basically lst is instance of list class and not list object(Which was written before in the notebook)

471,nightscout/cgm-remote-monitor,cpitchford,Optimize time between polling share2nightscout-bridge to reduce ingest lag,"This updates the polling interval for the share2nightscout-bridge fetch routine.

# Current behaviour

Where as previously the share2nightscout-bridge is called at a regular interval to poll Dexcom for new data, we now use the data we received to schedule the next poll. With a default poll time of 2.5 minutes, depending on when the nightscout process is started, we could see up to a 2.5 minute lag between the new data being sent by the Dexcom app and it appearing in the nightscout feed.

# Optimisation

We know that Dexcom updates every 5 minutes. We also know that it takes under 20 seconds for the new data sent by the Dexcom App to appear in the Dexcom feed.

We look at the timestamp of the most recently collected data, add 5 minutes and 20 seconds to this time to find the next poll time.

If this time is in the past or if this poll time is more than the poll interval in the future, we revert to regular interval polling. This reverts to the previous behaviour whilst we await new data from Dexcom.

Once new data is provided, we attempt to re-schedule the next collection optimally.

For example:

  * The last data was collected at 12:00:00
  * The next poll should be 12:00:00 + 5 minutes + 20 seconds: 12:05:20
  * The time now is 12:04:00
  * The next poll should be in 1minutes 20 seconds. This is a reduction over the periodic polling interval of 2.5 minutes.

# Result expected

This update will reduce the random lag of up to 2.5 minutes to a reliable 20 seconds

Then again, it is stored to t1 which is unsigned so the overflow disappears.
Keeping all unsigned is safer.

However, this script will throw an exception if the header file included non-ASCII characters, since the files are opened and saved in ASCII mode. This change ensures that headers are read and written as UTF-8 encoded files instead of ascii.

Changed type of face_detection_args to uint64_t because the compiler was inferring the type of face_detection_args as std::size_t and giving requires narrowing conversion error on msvs compilers.

Hopefully this fixes it.

679,opencv/opencv,cesarpgouveia,fix transpose onnx layers (permute cuda) for size 1x1x1x1,"**Context**

I have an mxnet model, which I then converted to onnx. The converted onnx model ended up having a transpose layer with a matrix of 1x1x1x1. When running this on **OpenCV 4.5.3** with support for **opencvdnn** and **CUDA 10.1**. I ended up with a crash on permute.hpp which after some debug analysis I found out that the crash was caused by the code not supporting that particular dimension (all ones, 1x1x1x1) for permutation. I made a fix to the code to support this scenario. Please feel free to change the code if you think it could be more optimized.

**PR description**

Fixed bug while infering on custom onnx model in CUDA. Onnx custom model which has a transpose layer (mapped to a permute in CUDA) with the following dimensions: 1x1x1x1. The permute.hpp code does not take into account a possible case of a 1x1x1x1 matrix which then leads to a crash (segmentation fault).

710,opencv/opencv,Ryyyc,"Add support for 3D point cloud segmentation, using the USAC framework.","According to the previous plan(LINK we want to merge the 3D point cloud plane segmentation algorithm into OpenCV. After analyzing the `usac` part of OpenCV's 3D module, we decided to slightly adapt and extend it to support segmentation of 3D point cloud basic geometric models (plane, sphere, cylinder, etc.).

Now the segmentation of the plane and the sphere has been tentatively completed.

---

To summarize the main work of this PR.
1. Moved class *Ransac* from `3d/src/usac/ransac_solvers.cpp` to `3d/src/usac.hpp` (and renamed it to *UniversalRANSAC*) so that it can be used elsewhere. And the first argument of the constructor of this class was modified(Replaced by a new interface `UsacConfig`), the reason for the modification was that the original interface was strongly coupled with the Homography part.
2. Added `PlaneModelError`, `SphereModelError`, interfaces defined in `3d/src/usac.hpp` and implemented in `3d/src/usac/estimator.cpp`. Their role is to estimate the error of the plane and sphere models respectively, and they will be used in the class *UniversalRANSAC*.
3. Added `PlaneModelMinimalSolver`, `PlaneModelNonMinimalSolver`, `SphereModelMinimalSolver`, `SphereModelNonMinimalSolver`, interfaces are defined in `3d/src/ usac.hpp`, implemented in `3d/src/usac/plane_solver.cpp.cpp`, `3d/src/usac/sphere_solver.cpp`. Their role is to estimate the minimum sampling model and the non-minimum sampling model for the plane and the sphere, respectively.
4. Added `PointCloudModelEstimator`, the interface is defined in `3d/src/usac.hpp` and implemented in `3d/src/usac/estimator.cpp`. Its role is to estimate point cloud models based on sampled points and decide whether to use them based on user-defined constraints.
5. New class *PointCloudWrapper*, which is defined in `3d/src/ptcloud/ptcloud_wrapper.hpp`, its role is a simple encapsulation of the access pointer to 3D point cloud data, avoiding the repetition of redundant construction code, It is used by Solver, Error.
6. New class *SACSegmentation*, which is defined in `3d/include/opencv2/3d/ptcloud.hpp` and implemented in `3d/src/ptcloud/sac_segmentation.cpp`, its role is to use the SAmple Consensus algorithm for 3D point clouds for basic geometric model segmentation, currently supporting the segmentation of planes and spheres using the RANSAC algorithm. The user will make use of the class *SACSegmentation*.

When then calling trilinearInterpolate, the index is definitely outside the LUT at LINK which is a security issue.

Yes, normal users should not use NaN, but malicious users will.

Here are the other possible solutions:

- we first scan for any NaN and throw an error is there is any (that should be documented and replicated to the other color conversions)
- add an Assert but that would be per pixel (a DbgAssert would not be called in production code)
- add a default behavior like I did which is the smallest change

Please advise.

757,opencv/opencv,hanliutong,Further optimize DNN for RISC-V Vector.,"This patch is going to further optimize DNN for RVV based on my GSoC work. The previous version is #20521.

There are 3 changes in this patch.

1. Using `vsetvl` instead of a branch to handle vector tail (The last few elements of each row, which can not fill the entire vector register).

    I wrote an example on [Godbolt ](LINK the different between using `vsetvl`  and using `if`  to show that use of `vsetvl` eliminates conditional jumps and just introduce a statement (sub).
2. Unify the name of variables, which is about `vl`

    The variable naming in each function before is independent and unfriendly to readers. So I modified the variable name about `vl` with the same rule. For now, in all 4 functions:

    - All the following variables are used for `vl` parameters in intrinsic, but different names have different meanings:
`vlm<LMUL>` :  The maximum value that `vl` can be set for a certain LMUL. It is a constant value.
`vl` :  The number of elements processed in each inner loop, which will be used to process tail in the final loop.
`unroll_tail` : The number of elements processed in each outer loop, also used to process tail in the final loop, but this tail is caused by loop unrolling

    - And there are new parameters intrudced by CHANGE 1 called `avl`, which represents the number of unprocessed elements, and used as the parameter of `vsetvl`.

3. Update the way function `fastConv` handles the matrix tail (The last few rows of the matrix, usually caused by loop unrolling, the `vl` for matrix tail is called `unroll_tail` in CHANGE 2).

    In previous version, I use both vl and mask for the matrix tail to handle the different sizes of the blocksize and [here](LINK is the discussion at the time. However, mask usually takes a lot of costs and I find a new way to only use vl to handle that. With that, no mask, even no additional branch is needed.

I have already tested this patch on QEMU, the minimal DNN test data set show the same result on the patch and on the master branch:
```
[==========] 1687 tests from 77 test cases ran. (73103 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 1684 tests.
[  FAILED  ] 3 tests, listed below:

833,tensorflow/models,Apidwalin,LICENSE_PYTHON,"A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
==========================

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see LINK in the Netherlands
as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see LINK
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became
Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see
LINK was formed, a non-profit organization
created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.
Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see LINK for
the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
the various releases.

    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-
                    from                                compatible? (1)

    0.9.0 thru 1.2              1991-1995   CWI         yes
    1.3 thru 1.5.2  1.2         1995-1999   CNRI        yes
    1.6             1.5.2       2000        CNRI        no
    2.0             1.6         2000        BeOpen.com  no
    1.6.1           1.6         2001        CNRI        yes (2)
    2.1             2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         no
    2.0.1           2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         yes
    2.1.1           2.1+2.0.1   2001        PSF         yes
    2.1.2           2.1.1       2002        PSF         yes
    2.1.3           2.1.2       2002        PSF         yes
    2.2 and above   2.1.1       2001-now    PSF         yes

Footnotes:

(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.

(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
    is ""not incompatible"" with the GPL.

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
direction to make these releases possible.

when sub layers are created in `self.build` with subsequent `build` call, the names of the weights of sublayers get the name of the main layer which prevents keras saving in `h5` format. Fix it by moving layer creation into init, then they will be built when they are called.
