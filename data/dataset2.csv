88,trekhleb/javascript-algorithms,austintheriot,Refactored merge sort to use array pointers instead of .shift(),"The previous implementation of merge sort used the array.shift() method to merge elements from leftArray and rightArray into the sorted array. This is a bad practice, because JavaScript's implementation of the Array.prototype.shift() method is, at worst, O(n) runtime complexity, where n is the length of the array being sorted (in order to move n elements of an array over by 1, all n elements of the array must typically be touched).

To work around this, I refactored merge sort to use array pointers instead. Now, after an element has been added to the sorted array, rather than delete it from the old array and shift the entire old array over, the array index pointer is just incremented to the right by one to avoid the old element. This will always require O(1) runtime complexity, which is a significant performance boost.

I also added two simple concat() statements to the returned sortedArray value, because the length of the left and right arrays can no longer be used to determine if an element is still ""dangling"" (needing to be added to the sorted array).

All tests passed after my changes.

However, I'm not sure there'd be much value in that - lots of people will update to get eslint 8 support, so it's a nice opportunity to add ""exports"" and enable more useful rules and get maximum exposure for that. Separately, at this point I'm not sure who's still using eslint 5 or 6, considering how much new syntax requires eslint 7 or 8 to support (even via babel's or typescript's eslint parser) and how hungry people often are for new syntax.

Due to the way we share packages in this quasi-monorepo, I've been forced to disable a number of tests. These will be re-enabled once I open the PR to update the react config (after the base config is published) which hopefully won't be too long (and I won't be making any meaningful changes to the react config during that gap anyways).

The current reason for preferring object destructuring is quite narrow in scope. It could be improved to meet this standard, so I'm proposing adding some additional information to clarify the benefits of what is an often controversial rule (controversial only because its introduction can require many changes in a mature codebase and has no auto fix available).",1

310,TheAlgorithms/Python,NoahSchiro,Trig functions (Fixes: #2000),"### Describe your change:
I added the 6 trigonometric functions. For sin and cos I used a maclaurin series approximations. For tan, csc, sec, and cot, I used trig identities and my aforementioned sin and cos algorithm. No external library (including the math library that ships with python) was used. I did use CODE so that I could use a precise value of pi, but this only served for accurate testing of the algorithms and did not actually factor into the algorithms themselves.

I think the cosine algorithm needs some work, it has a variance around 1E-15 currently but I am unsure of how to improve the accuracy (there are some pythonic limits to how far I can take an infinite series. Namely an infinite series which contains a factorial).

Additionally, I think there should also be the inverse trigonometric functions in this repository but I am not currently aware of an algorithm and it might be better saved for a separate pull request

merge_insertion_sort

Co-Authored-By: AilisOsswald <44617437+AilisOsswald@users.noreply.github.com>


### Describe your change:
We fixed the Issue of Merge-insertion-Sort not sorting correctly.

We have seen that there is already a PR but we would like to present our fix since it is a little bit different: LINK


We have left all Code as it was before, except line 163
original:
 if result[i] == collection[-i]:
corrected: 
 if result[i] == collection[-1]:

because as the flag name states we want to check if the current item in result is the last item of our input list.  (which would be collection[-1] not [-i]

We think that both solutions should work, but the solution with checking (as described above) should perform a tiny bit better. 
Normally we do this, since we know everything left to the current value is smaller than the value we will have to sort in: 
 result = result[: i + 1] + binary_search_insertion(result[i + 1 :], pivot)

If we find the last_odd_item in our result list, we know the same thing like above and we know that there is one additional value, which is already sorted - the last_odd_item. And with that knowlegde we can make the list we have to search through smaller and the list we don't have to look at larger by one each:
 result = result[: i + 1 +1] + binary_search_insertion(result[i + 1 :], pivot)

Keeping this flag in the code should make it a bit quicker, since in some cases the list to be searched through is one element smaller.

Our next step would be writing more tests as suggested in this issue #5774. Should this be done in the same issue or in a new one?

+ As per usage examples, clause literals are a list of strings.
  + Note: symbols extracted from literals are expected to be exactly two characters.
+ self.literal boolean values are initialized to None, so must be optional
+ model values should be Booleans, but aren't guaranteed to be non-None
  in the code.
+ uses newer '... | None' annotation for Optional values
+ clauses are passed to the Formula initializer as both lists and sets, they
  are stored as lists.  Returned clauses will always be lists.
+ use explicit tuple annotation from __future__  rather than using (..., ...)
  in return signatures
+ mapping returned by dpll_algorithm is optional per the documentation.

+ As per usage examples, clause literals are a list of strings.
  + Note: symbols extracted from literals are expected to be exactly two characters.
+ self.literal boolean values are initialized to None, so must be optional
+ model values should be Booleans, but aren't guaranteed to be non-None
  in the code.
+ uses newer '... | None' annotation for Optional values
+ clauses are passed to the Formula initializer as both lists and sets, they
  are stored as lists.  Returned clauses will always be lists.
+ use explicit tuple annotation from __future__  rather than using (..., ...)
  in return signatures
+ mapping returned by dpll_algorithm is optional per the documentation.

Annotation and improvements for lru_cache and lfu_cache.  
These contain a lot of duplicated code so I have put them into a single PR.

+ Annotates existing lru_cache algorithm
+ Adds tests for the internal double linked list
+ Expands algorithm annotations to be generic of key and value types
+ Added __repr__ to enable clean doctests and clarity in the repl
+ mypy required using `setattr` rather than creating an attr through assignment.

+ Makes analogous changes to lfu_cache.

PR is broken into multiple commits each handling a logical chunk and is meant to be clear when viewing each commit individually.

   - **Plotting:** It was several build-in plotting functionalities to help the user understand the optimization process and take decisions over the models.
   - **Tensorboard:** It can log with just a single line of code all the evaluation metrics to a tensorboard instance to monitor the training.

A suite of utilities for AWS Lambda functions to ease adopting best practices such as tracing, structured logging, custom metrics async, parameters and secrets management, idempotency, and more.

## What's the difference between this Python project and similar ones?

**Tenets**

This project separates core utilities that will be available in other runtimes vs general utilities that might not be available across all runtimes.

- **AWS Lambda only** We optimise for AWS Lambda function environments and supported runtimes only. Utilities might work with web frameworks and non-Lambda environments, though they are not officially supported.
- **Eases the adoption of best practices**. The main priority of the utilities is to facilitate best practices adoption, as defined in the AWS Well-Architected Serverless Lens; all other functionality is optional.
- **Keep it lean**. Additional dependencies are carefully considered for security and ease of maintenance, and prevent negatively impacting startup time.
- **We strive for backwards compatibility**. New features and changes should keep backwards compatibility. If a breaking change cannot be avoided, the deprecation and migration process should be clearly defined.
- **We work backwards from the community**. We aim to strike a balance of what would work best for 80% of customers. Emerging practices are considered and discussed via Requests for Comment (RFCs)
Idiomatic. Utilities follow programming language idioms and language-specific best practices.

**Highlighted Features**

- **Tracing** - Decorators and utilities to trace Lambda function handlers, and both synchronous and asynchronous functions
- **Logging** - Structured logging made easier, and decorator to enrich structured logging with key Lambda context details
- **Metrics** - Custom Metrics created asynchronously via CloudWatch Embedded Metric Format (EMF)
Bring your own middleware - Decorator factory to create your own middleware to run logic before, and after each Lambda invocation
- **Parameters utility** - Retrieve and cache parameter values from Parameter Store, Secrets Manager, or DynamoDB
- **Batch processing** - Handle partial failures for AWS SQS batch processing
- **Typing** - Static typing classes to speedup development in your IDE
- **Validation** - JSON Schema validator for inbound events and responses
- **Event source data classes** - Data classes describing the schema of common Lambda event triggers
- **Parser** - Data parsing and deep validation using Pydantic
- **Idempotency** - Convert your Lambda functions into idempotent operations which are safe to retry
- **Event Handler** - Decorators to help simplify AppSync [GraphQL] and API Gateway events. Think Flask for AWS Lambda
- **Feature Flags** - A simple rule engine to evaluate when one or multiple features should be enabled depending on the input

What the heck is Sqllex? 🤔

Sqllex is a python library created to make it easier for developers to interact with databases. Currently it supports only SQLite databases but we’re planning to expand this list soon. SQLite is a nice and simple tool for admining databases, but Sqllex makes it even more easy and comfortable.

It'll be a lot easier to show then explain. Wiki / examples: LINK

## What is this Python project?

When working with date and time information in Python, you commonly use the classes date, datetime and/or time from the datetime package. Babel provides functions for locale-specific formatting of those objects in its dates module.

## What's the difference between this Python project and similar ones?

Python’s datetime module has different ways to deal with times and dates: naive and timezone-aware datetime objects.

Babel generally recommends you to store all your time in naive datetime objects and treat them as UTC at all times. This simplifies dealing with time a lot because otherwise you can get into the hairy situation where you are dealing with datetime objects of different timezones.

Ariadne is a Python library for implementing GraphQL servers using a schema-first approach.

Schema-first approach - unlike graphene the schema is defined explicitly and is not inferred from code, it's more light-weight and less opinionated, it has subscriptions, file uploads,  tracing and other useful stuff built-in.

Example hello world app with starlette:
```py
from ariadne import QueryType, make_executable_schema
from ariadne.asgi import GraphQL
from starlette.applications import Starlette

type_defs = """"""
    type Query {
        hello: String!

query = QueryType()


@query.field(""hello"")

### Description of your *pull request* and other information

The  Niconico extractor has been broken following site changes, and also served files that couldn't be downloaded in a single yt-dl run because the server cancelled the download in the absence of a regular heartbeat POST.

The corresponding module in yt-dlp has been actively maintained and additional search extractors have been implemented, as well as adding support for the heartbeat function for downloads.

This PR adapts the current version of the yt-dlp module to yt-dl conventions, in particular replacing `f'strings'` and `yield from`.

The playlist limit in download tests from yt-dlp is implemented.

Additionally, if the optional `threading` module is available, the heartbeat function is enabled for DMC-type downloads. This requires a small change to `downloader/__init__.py`

Credit goes to @CXwudi, @animelover1984 and @pukkandan for recent changes on the yt-dlp version, and see also [below](LINK for other contributors.

The PR should fix these issues where extraction failed:
* resolve #29225

Add checks for external downloader:
1. if unknown/unsupported downloader is specified, raise explicit exception instead of now causing KeyError, like:
```
  File ""/usr/local/bin/youtube-dl/youtube_dl/YoutubeDL.py"", line 1910, in dl
  File ""/usr/local/bin/youtube-dl/youtube_dl/downloader/__init__.py"", line 42, in get_suitable_downloader
  File ""/usr/local/bin/youtube-dl/youtube_dl/downloader/external.py"", line 371, in get_external_downloader
KeyError: 'DOWNLOADER'
```
2. if downloader is not found in PATH, raise exception instead of ignoring/skipping silently,
also distinguish avconv from ffmpeg to not use ffmpeg if avconv is specified (or vice versa)
3. if downloader will not be used for protocol, show warning when continuing (related to #29813)

2nd condition above may be strict, but I think it should have been done.
3rd condition continues to work, as the user should not be made strongly aware of the protocol.

    LINK
- Another one for downloading all videos from a Douyin user page, e.g.

The video extractor is superior to the one proposed in PR LINK as it does not depend on JSON data embedded into the video's webpage but directly utilizes Douyin's REST API instead. Furthermore, as stated above this PR also provides an extractor for downloading videos from user pages.",1

### Description of your *pull request* and other information

Add `range` and `mediaRange` attributes support of these types to dash mpd parser:
- segment URLs and range (resolves #30235)
- no segment URLs but range (can supersede #14648)

Also modified the existing code a bit at `# Segment URLs with no SegmentTimeline` in `extractor/common.py` for clarity, IMO.

**Regarding the `ftyp` box**

There seem to be some mpds that do not include `ftyp` box in the initialization segment because the range doesn't start from 0. As a result, the downloaded files do not have the box either. Such mpds are, for example, LINK in #30235 and `url_and_range.mpd` made with Bento4 I added for test to this PR.
`url_and_range.mpd` has `<Initialization sourceURL=""video-frag.mp4"" range=""36-746""/>`. If the source video file starts like
```
000000  0000 0024 6674 7970 6973 6f6d 0000 0200    ...$ftypisom....
000010  6973 6f6d 6973 6f32 6176 6331 6d70 3431    isomiso2avc1mp41
000020  6973 6f35 0000 02c7 6d6f 6f76 0000 006c    iso5....moov...l
000030  6d76 6864 0000 0000 ddc7 5e78 ddc7 5e78    mvhd......^x..^x
```
then the downloaded file will start like
```
000000  0000 02c7 6d6f 6f76 0000 006c 6d76 6864    ....moov...lmvhd
000010  0000 0000 ddc7 5e78 ddc7 5e78 0000 03e8    ......^x..^x....
```
This usually won't be a problem nor emerge because youtube-dl runs ffmpeg to merge video and audio, and the file will be adjusted. And for `m4a_dash` audio-only stream, fixup will be done.

While the video-only file seems to play fine with, say, VLC and QuickTime Player, I'm thinking of making another PR to run ffmpeg for fixup.

### Description of your *pull request* and other information

There are problems in post-processing for HLS:
- If native HLS downloader is used for a video-only stream, `FFmpegFixupM3u8PP` does nothing and file is left MPEG-TS. (#26410)
- If native HLS downloader is selected but the download is delegated to ffmpeg, file will be MP4 by default. However, if audio is AAC, `FFmpegFixupM3u8PP` copies MP4 to MP4 unnecessarily.
- Merge fails when audio is MPEG-TS and AAC and ffmpeg is old. (#9913)

So I made the following modifications:
- For single HLS stream, test file format and convert MPEG-TS to MP4 in `FFmpegFixupM3u8PP`. (resolves #26410 and the second above)
- For streams to be merged, test audio stream and fix AAC in `FFmpegMergerPP`. (resolves #9913 essentially, resolves #10644, can supersede #10645)
- Added to get file format in `get_audio_codec()`, thus renamed.

And I slightly modified messages to fit the change of purpose:
- From <code><i>VIDEO-ID</i>: malformed AAC bitstream detected</code> to <code>Container might be left MPEG-TS in ""<i>FILENAME</i>""</code> in `YoutubeDL.py`.
Also modified to show filename instead of video-id; I think it would be helpful for users to know filename rather than video-id.
- From <code>Fixing malformed AAC bitstream in ""<i>FILENAME</i>""</code> to <code>Correcting container in ""<i>FILENAME</i>""</code> in `FFmpegFixupM3u8PP`.",2

### Description of your *pull request* and other information

This adds support for **podchaser.com**, a podcast aggregator. All the podcast info is grabbed from JSON embedded in the HTML. If multiple episodes are found, it returns a playlist--otherwise, just the one result.

A couple notes:

 - Currently, the json is written in such a way that the only way I know to parse it is to parse it twice. Maybe it's double encoded? I tried running it through `_escape_html`, but that wasn't working, so right now if _parse_json returns a string, it parses again so it returns a dict.
 ```
        while isinstance(data, compat_str):
            data = self._parse_json(data, audio_id)
``` 

 - When I tested this on Python 2.7, it threw a `DownloadError: ERROR: Unable to download webpage: HTTP Error 403: Forbidden`. I'll keep working on fixing that, but until then, I thought I'd throw this up in case someone has a simple answer for that

#### JSON-LD extraction improvements

  * Support top-level @graph expressing implicit default graph
    * Wrap the control flow block in a function, which is called recursively upon such a structure
    * Per [W3C JSON-LD v1.1 §4.9 (non-normative ref)](LINK

> When a JSON-LD document's top-level structure is a map that contains no other keys than `@graph` and optionally `@context` (properties that are not mapped to an IRI or a keyword are ignored), `@graph` is  considered to express the otherwise implicit default graph.

  * Extend `TestInfoExtractor.test_search_json_ld_realworld` to cover said syntax (structure)
    * Refactor tests in a list of 3-tuples: test html string, expected dict, keyword args for `InfoExtractor._search_json_ld`
    * Add new test case for said syntax (structure)
  * Tweak description extraction from nodes with type `Article` or `NewsArticle`: extract description from `articleBody` and fall back to `description` field",3

### Description of your *pull request* and other information

This patch adds support for video extraction from ant1news.gr, a popular Greek content provider and established TV network.

* Add new IEs
  * Ant1NewsGrBaseIE: Base IE class
  * Ant1NewsGrWatchIE: Extract videos from TV VOD pages
  * Ant1NewsGrArticleIE: Extract videos from news articles
  * Ant1NewsGrEmbedIE: Extract iframe-embeddable ant1news.gr videos
* NB: There is a different platform at vod.antenna.gr, which is not covered here
* The Generic extractor can also be used to extract videos from news article pages (through `Ant1NewsGrEmbed._extract_urls`), however a specific IE is used to extract JSON-LD `@type='NewsArticle'` metadata
  * Yet that does not work currently, as `InfoExtractor._json_ld` does not support `@graph` nesting (see #30229 for a fix)
* Ant1NewsGrArticleIE defers to Ant1NewsGrEmbedIE, either as a playlist or a single video
* Ant1NewsGrWatchIE and Ant1NewsGrEmbedIE query an API endpoint to extract metadata, get the respective stream/source URLs and detect video formats
  * The endpoint HTTP path varies per IE
  * Ant1NewsGrEmbedIE first resolves any redirects for its' own URL, to derive the proper base URL for the API query",3

* Add new IEs

* Derive metadata and sources directly from the web page, from data attributes of the player placeholder element and other commonly used elements
* Let MegaTVComEmbedIE defer to MegaTVComIE for extraction, as the metadata on the embeddable page are some times slightly different, for the same video",4

TikTok now (since a few days ago?) uses a different format for metadata when the user is logged in (I used a cookie file exported from Chrome).

### Description of your *pull request* and other information

This patch adds support for Glomex videos, both embeddable and on the (demo) site video.glomex.com. Glomex operates a media exchange platform, which powers their video marketplace service, based on revenue sharing. This is used quite a lot in large parts of Europe, primarily by digital news outlets, which embed in their assets video clips provided by various content providers (for example TV channels), tied with advertising. 

* Add new IEs
  * GlomexBaseIE: Base IE class
  * GlomexIE: Extract videos from video.glomex.com (by deferring to glomex:embed)
    * The integrationId parameter is apparently common across video.glomex.com, but we have to hard-code it as it is very hard to extract otherwise: it is deeply hidden in a script asset (a webpack component, which is typically regularly updated)
  * GlomexEmbedIE: Extract Glomex videos by matching the player URL
* Query the API to extract metadata, detect video formats and get the respective (JWT protected) stream/source URLs
* The API query may return one or more videos: the latter case is treated as a playlist
  * As this is otherwise identically handled, a separate IE was not deemed necessary
  * However title and description fields are not set for playlist results
    * They do not exist in the parent object; obtaining them from the first entry is not indicative for the playlist content
    * As the playlist order is not always stable (this is true at least for related videos playlists), it makes writing test cases impossible
* Let GenericIE detect embeds by matching all three integration methods:
  * HTML: glomex-player tag or data attributes
  * Javascript: naive parsing of inline scripts for string constants assigned to integration parameters
  * Iframe: src attribute GlomexEmbedIE._VALID_URL
* Let GlomexIE and the former embed detection pass the origin URL to GlomexEmbedIE by smuggling it in the player URL, as this is an expected parameter in API requests
* Add test cases for both single videos and two playlist flavors",8

Adds a new argument `--ffmpeg-out-override` and gives these arguments to FFmpeg in place of `-c copy` (which is currently always used) when present. The similar more general option `external-downloader-args` is not suited for this use case.
This would enable transcoding and compressing videos without first saving them as ""copied"" from the source.
An example use case would look like this: `youtube-dl --ffmpeg-out-override ""-c:v libx265 -crf 31"" some_source`. I've found it very useful with sources that normally yield very large video files.
The current name of the argument is questionable, maybe it should be changed before merging.",1

### Description of your *pull request* and other information

As part of the PR ""[[youtube] Fix throttling by decrypting n-sig](LINK @pukkandan implemented a more capable version of the JS interpreter module. Although it's not needed for the [equivalent fix in yt-dl](LINK having the same level of capability in yt-dl would facilitate other back-ports, eg in case a more complex YouTube challenge should have to be decoded in future. It might also suffice for certain other extractors where some JS trickery needs to be emulated.

This PR back-ports the `jsinterp.py` from LINK with changes to make it run in 2.6 <= Python < 3.6 as well.
* `yield from` becomes nested iterator
* `nonlocal` faked by a dummy namespace class
* f'...' replaced by various older format syntaxes
* replace `collections.abc` with `compat_collections_abc` added to `compat.py`.

All the tests in the unchanged back-ported `test/test_jsinterp.py` pass.

### Description of your *pull request* and other information

Since summer 2021, YouTube has started serving media URLs with a query parameter such as `...&n=SXiXBH-xzrjeioPN&...`. This now appears to be the default behaviour. Unless the value of this parameter is transformed according to an algorithm delivered in the site player JS, the download speed for the URL is throttled to ~50kB/s.

Solutions for this include:
* implementing a more complete JS interpreter, eg based on PR #11272;
* using an external JS interpreter (PhantomJS, now unmaintained, is used by some extractors);
* spoofing the Android or iOS client to acquire unthrottled links, as successfully implemented in [yt-dlp](LINK

This PR takes a different approach derived from the successful solution used in VLC's `youtube.lua` (also implemented differently in [pytube](LINK The approach relies on the fact that the challenge algorithm is served in a mini-language within the minified player JS and therefore the specific algorithm can be extracted and executed by interpreting the mini-language without actually running the JS itself. [In parallel with this PR, a separate implementation of this approach, but also using a more complete JS interpreter, was added to [yt-dlp](LINK

The implementation of the mini-language interpreter is directly translated from VLC's `n_descramble()` [Lua function](LINK The result sufficiently resembles the original that it should be straightforward to share changes between the two implementations.

The PR also includes fixes for `test/test_youtube_lists.py`. This download test failed in Python 2 and contained tests that failed or were redundant because of obsolete assumptions about the `youtube.py` extractor or YouTube services.

Around 2021-11-12, YT has started to send (in player 8d287e4d) commands of the form `c[i](c[j],c[k],c[l]())`. In this player, `c[l]` computes a base64 alphabet in the normal daftly obfuscated way, while `c[i]` is just the `compound()` function used for two of the exiting transformations. Additionally, the descrambler array `c[]` could have ad hoc updates `c[i]=c` after its declaration (player 2dfe380c) and integer constants could be expressed as float literals (player f1ca6900). 

Apparently there is this built-in media-player functionality in HTML5 browsers. Perhaps YT might use that instead of sending a 2MB JS file to every client.

Anyone who wants a single file update to fix the 2021.06.06 release pending merge/release of the PR should use [this version of `extractor/youtube.py`](LINK which is a drop-in replacement.

Since such users ran the embedding application or connected to the embedding service, they are generally not competent to respond to an error message that asks them to run youtube-dl with certain command-line options and therefore cannot be helped to solve the issue. They should instead turn to the support channel for the embedding application and service.

This PR adds the ArteTVCategoryIE to support the latter playlist type. Unlike the collection playlists, the page is not populated from the API, so the extractor scrapes the page.

### Description of your *pull request* and other information

The structure of pages at paramountplus.com has changed, as well that of some pages handled by other extractor modules such as cbs.py and theplatform.py.

This PR back-ports the required changes from [yt-dlp ](LINK with some small changes to match the platform and API. ParamountPlus ParamountPlusSeries extractors are added, with supporting changes to CBS and ThePlatform extractors.

A `_match_valid_url()` method is included in the `ThePlatformBaseIE` class, which can be removed if PR #30046 has been merged.

The PR is expected (as far as possible) to
* resolve #29564
* resolve #30066
* resolve #30197
* resolve #30247.

The tests needed to be run in the USA before merging, as the ParamountPlus URLs are strongly geo-blocked. The CI runs seem to have passed that check.

### Description of your *pull request* and other information

Sometimes I just want to know whether youtube-dl can be expected to handle a given URL.  This option accomplishes that quickly.  Previously, I would run youtube-dl with --simulate or --skip-download, but these would take 5+ seconds on my system before returning.  The --determine-extractors option of this PR, however, only takes 1.3 to 2.6 seconds.  You can use it, for example, to handle arbitrary URLs intelligently:  If --determine-extractors indicates success, run youtube-dl (or mpv or whatever).  Otherwise, run $BROWSER.

### Description of your *pull request* and other information

In the IE `_is_valid_url()` method, the URL is tested for validity. The resource linked may be a large media file which could be downloaded and then discarded. An early version of the method used a `HEAD` request, as would be expected. This was then changed to `GET` in 4069766c527d10b8e25b9262a3882101367deb3e, but there is no supporting rationale and no issues mentioning that `HEAD` requests were being rejected.

If that should be a problem with a specific site, we can set a class var, say `_test_valid_with_GET = False` and then make the changed lines as follows, with the var set to `True` for the problem site:
```
            req = url if self._test_valid_with_GET else HEADRequest(url)
            self._request_webpage(req, video_id, 'Checking %s URL' % item, headers=headers)
```

This commit is to fix the recently broken reddit extractor (see issue #29986). Testing determined that the requests would be allowed so long as the `reddit_session` cookie is set to a value. Currently, the actual value of the cookie does not seem to matter; any value will allow access.

This PR sets the cookie to a random 16-character hex string (e.g., `63cd23c3d6a68191`). This is easy to generate, and avoids any potential issues that might crop up if every youtube-dl user started using the same session ID.",1

### Description of your *pull request* and other information

If the destination filename constructed from the output template is too long for the filesystem, the yt-dl download fails. The user can't predict how long extracted fields (eg `title`) may be, so this may be unexpected. The user then has to work out how to modify the output template (eg `%(title)s` -> `%(title).25s`) and run the command again.

Consequently there have been suggestions (of which #29912 is the most recent) that the destination filename should be shortened automatically. This doesn't seem unreasonable, since `sanitize_path()` already has the potential to edit the filename. PR #25475 failed because it was platform-specific.

This PR adds a function `reduce_filename()` to `utils.py` that shortens the filename component by a specified  factor, and adds logic to `sanitize_open()` to detect `errno.ENAMETOOLONG` and iteratively call `reduce_filename()` until opening either succeeds, or fails for some other reason.

Resolves #29912, resolves #29975, resolves #29627, resolves #28626, resolves #7765, resolves #5921, resolves #5908, probably others.",2

The SlidesLive extractor now needs a `player_token` query parameter in the JSON URL, whose value is given by the `data-player-token` attribute in the HTML element (`<div>`) with `id=""player""`.

Also, some of the expected metadata (`timestamp`, eg) wasn't being collected.

### Description of your *pull request* and other information

This PR makes two small and one larger improvement to `test/test_download.py`, in 3 separate commits. 

#### <a id=""file-hash"">Calculating the file hash</a>

External downloaders may not support limiting the download exactly to a specified size. When running a test download, only a short initial portion of the file is supposed to be downloaded, and the hash is calculated from that portion. If the portion is longer than requested the hash will be incorrect. The PR explicitly uses the requested length, if specified, when calculating the file hash, so that the same value should be calculated regardless of downloader.

#### <a id=""header-params"">Header-related params in test cases</a>

Header-related params (here: `--user-agent`, `--referer`, `--add-header`) are parsed into `std_headers` rather than the `params` dict in the main yt-dl program. In download tests, only params that are set into the `params` dict were supported, and header-related params in test cases were ignored. This PR changes the params processing for test downloads to match what happens in the main program.

As an example, the change makes it possible to specify a test case with a specific UA, such as this for an Invidious site fronted by Cloudflare
```
        ...
        'params': {
            # Cloudflare breaks HTTP if Chrome is mentioned in the UA (2021-08)
            'user_agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/6533.18.5 (KHTML, like Gecko) Safari/6533.18.5',
        },                                       
        ...
```
#### <a id=""test-all"">Add TestSuite test_..._all with all downloads for each extractor</a>

When testing downloads for an extractor XXX, a set of test cases is created but it's not obvious which item in the extractor's `_TESTS` list corresponds to which `TestDownload.test_XXX...` test case. If there are many test cases one might fail to run some of the later tests, or run past the highest numbered case.

To facilitate running the download tests for an extractor in the same way that they run in the CI servers, the PR adds a further download test case with name suffix `_all` for each extractor class that has test case(s). The new test case is a `unittest.TestSuite` that runs all the other download tests for that extractor. Counts of the possible test outcomes (error, failure, etc) are printed.

Thus to test `YoutubeIE`:
```
python test/test_download.py TestDownload.test_Youtube_all
```

### Description of your *pull request* and other information

Invidious is an open-source front-end to YouTube that is hosted on various host names. Invidious URLs were supported in the YT extractor through a list of Invidious sites in the `_INVIDIOUS_SITES` variable initialised in `extractor/youtube-dl.py`. As in issue #29885, other Invidious sites may be set up (or discontinued) at any time.

As the Invidious site list is dynamic (more so than yt-dl releases), a better detection method was needed, not relying on a site list.

In [this comment](LINK I proposed a general mechanism by which an extractor could be selected based on the page content, rather than just the URL, so as to avoid handling the details of such pages in the Generic extractor.

This PR adds an Invidious extractor class to `extractor/youtube.py` that is invoked using this mechanism.

It supports video pages, and also extracts videos from playlists, channels and search pages, including further  pages (starting from the URL given). Playlist results sometimes have fewer items than when the YoutubePlaylistIE is used, because the result list is globally de-duplicated.

If this is accepted, a subsequent improvement would be to change the stub code in the Generic extractor so that pages are automatically checked against any active extractor class that implements the `page_suitable()` class method, and to move the `page_url_result()` class method to the base `InfoExtractor` class.

### Description of your *pull request* and other information

Issue #571 led to a commit implementing a requirement that ID fields used in output templates shouldn't be changed in filename generation.

Issue #5035 asked for initial '-' and '.' to be removed from filenames generated by yt-dl. This was implemented with the exception of ID fields, which must be rendered exactly, as above.

Issue #29875 identified that this implementation could cause unwanted changes in non-ID fields inside (rather than at the start of) an output template.

This PR re-implements the changes from issues #571 and #5035 to avoid the problem seen in issue #29875.

The existing unit test for `YoutubeDL.py` passes unchanged, while additional test cases have been included for issue #29875.

As the functionality for munging initial `[.-]` has been moved out of `sanitize_filename()`, the test cases for that have been deleted from the unit test for `utils.py` and replaced by new test cases for `YoutubeDL.py`.

As one result of the PR, the `FORMAT_RE` pattern is promoted to a class variable `_FORMAT_RE` that is available for use by methods of `YoutubeDL` and its subclasses.

The site has changed its API. Instead of the `*.beeg.com/api` APIs, the site fetches JSON metadata from `'LINK % video_id`. Video URLs can be found in the `resources` of the `file` object in the JSON. As the site is not good at titling, a default title is created of the form 'Beeg video VIDEO_ID'

The original extraction is left as a default.

Subtitles can be embedded in m4a same as mp4.

I imagine the reason m4a is not allowed now is because no one ever needed it or it is not video. However, given that webm may only contain audio, I think m4a should be allowed as well.

mpv shows subtitles fine for audio only files: on console, or on gui if thumbnail is embedded (or with --force-window=yes option).",1

The Vimeo extractor assumes that a URL to video metadata can be found (as a value assigned to `data-config-url`) in the video's page if it is a Channel video URL like LINK While this is true in that example, it's not always so. Videos linked from the 'Staff Picks' and 'Best of Staff Picks' channels may not have this, such as LINK

818,d3/d3,willsmythe,CI using Azure Pipelines from Microsoft,"I am a product manager at Microsoft and would like to help you enable continuous integration for the D3 repos using Azure Pipelines.  [Azure Pipeline](LINK is a CI integration service from Microsoft that is **free** for open source projects and supports build and test across Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## Summary

To get the ball rolling, I created pipelines for **28 of the D3 repos**. I chose these repos because they were the most consistent and would be fairly easy to script/automate the handful of necessary updates. 

At a high level, the changes were:

1. Added an `.azure-pipelines.yml` file that defines the CI jobs for Linux and Windows
2. Updated `package.json` with new CI-specific scripts (these scripts call existing scripts but generate XML output). I also had to swap a few commands (like `rm -rf`) with cross-platform alternatives
3. Updated `README.md` with a build status badge

Most of the (28) repos built correctly on Window sand Linux, but a few required some tweaks:

1. [d3-geo-projection](LINK and [d3-geo](LINK rely on node-canvas, which required installing some platform-specific dependencies.
2. [d3-axis](LINK had failing tests due to an assumption about the line endings being LF (not CRLF)
3. [d3](LINK doesn’t use eslint (which make sense) so I had to tweak the build configuration to not run lint or publish lint results

A handful of other repos like d3-timer have some legitimate-looking test failures (see [test results](LINK but I didn't dig too deep into them -- here's how the test results appear in the Azure Pipelines UI:

## package.json script updates

My main goals were to preserve the existing package.json script functionality and to avoid duplicating the test and lint commands. Here's a snippet from [d3-array/package.json](LINK

```json
{
  ""scripts"": {
    ""lint"": ""eslint src"",
    ""lint:ci"": ""yarn run lint -f junit -o test-results/lint.xml"",
    ""pretape"": ""rollup -c"",
    ""tape"": ""tape test/**/*-test.js"",
    ""tape:ci"": ""yarn run tape | tap-junit -o test-results -n tape.xml"",
    ""test"": ""yarn run tape && yarn run lint"",
    ""prepublishOnly"": ""rimraf dist && yarn test"",
    ""postpublish"": ""...""
  }
}
```

* `test` still runs both tape and lint, but the actual functionality has been broken out into separate scripts (`tape` and `run`) so they can be called by CI-specific scripts
* `rm -rf` was replaced with `rimraf`
* A handful of scripts set environment variables --- these had to be replaced with `cross-env`

## Next steps

If you are interested in moving forward, I can stage PRs for some/all of the other repos. I can also transfer the dev.azure.com/d3 Azure Pipelines org to you to save you the time of setting up the pipelines, wiring them up, etc. You can also ""start small"" and only use Azure Pipelines for a handful of your repos.

The issue was the tree.separation method was using the depth of the left and right nodes. In the case in which the root had only one child, both nodes were equal to root (left and right = root) which has a depth of 0 causing it to fail. So, on line 7053 of d3.js I made if (node.x < left.x) left = node; to if (node.x <= left.x) left = node;
I hope that is an appropriate fix. It passed all the tests.
Also, thank you for making d3. It is awesome!

881,d3/d3,cscheid,Adds support for domainSegmented() on quantitative scales.,"`domainSegmented()` splits the domain in segments which ""walk the range at uniform speed"". This means that if one replaces a 2-segment range [mn, mx] with a uniformly-split range [mn, ..., mx] of length l, then replacing the domain [mnD, mxD] with domainSegmented([mnD, mxD], l) will have no effect.

This transformation is useful when the range of a scale is (say) a highly-segmented colorbrewer scale, and one wishes to interpolate between the endpoints at the appropriate speed. More concretely, it allows one to easily change a colormap from:

`d3.scale.linear().domainSegmented([mnD, mxD], 6).range(colorbrewer.Blues[6])`

to

`d3.scale.log().domainSegmented([mnD, mxD], 6).range(colorbrewer.Blues[6])`

or

`d3.scale.pow().exponent(.5).domainSegmented([mnD, mxD], 6).range(colorbrewer.Blues[6])`

and the domain segments are split correctly.

The ability to pass an additional property bag to further configure NativeAnimated is useful for a few reasons, e.g., experimentation with multiple implementations of the NativeAnimated module.

The specific use case this solves is on react-native-windows, where there are two underlying animation graph options, one ""optimized"" animation graph that uses UI.Composition, and another similar to the approach to iOS and Android that uses a frame rendering callback.

The platform configuration can be supplied to the animation node when `useNativeDriver` is set to `true`, and we pass the platform configuration object to the connected AnimatedValue and all it's children.

Please provide enough information so that others can review your pull request. The three fields below are mandatory. -->

## Summary

React-native Xcode build steps (such as ""Build JS Bundle"") rely on `find.node-sh` to find the correct node binary, using nvm if present. We do this because Xcode may run build steps in a fresh shell environment, presumably for repeatable builds.

This PR fixes `find-node.sh`, to respect any `.nvmrc` file that may be present in the build environment.

Today: `find-node.sh` will set the shell environment to the system node version, and ignores any `.nvmrc` the project may provide to pin node for repeatable builds. By ignoring `.nvmrc`, node versions may differ depending on system environment — between developer laptops, or between developer and CI environments. 😞

This problem has been been noticed before in LINK

### Should this fix happen upstream?

Unfortunately this nvm behavior [is intended](LINK  for backwards compatibility

For consistency, I thought why not just use the same implementation on both iOS and Android.

It also seems more logical to use Chrono on iOS, since it has nanosecond precision and we just multiply it to milliseconds, whereas `CACurrentMediaTime` multiplies to seconds, and we divide it down to milliseconds again.

## Summary

When upgrading `react-native`, the version `RCT-Folly` defined [here](LINK can change. If that happens, if you run `pod install` after `yarn install`, you will get a similar error to this:
```
[!] CocoaPods could not find compatible versions for pod ""RCT-Folly"":
  In snapshot (Podfile.lock):
    RCT-Folly (from `../node_modules/react-native/third-party-podspecs/RCT-Folly.podspec`)

  In Podfile:
    RCT-Folly (from `../node_modules/react-native/third-party-podspecs/RCT-Folly.podspec`)

    React-RCTNetwork (from `../node_modules/react-native/Libraries/Network`) was resolved to 0.66.3, which depends on
      RCT-Folly (= 2021.06.28.00-v2)
```

This error occurs because `Cocoapods` does not update pods that point to a local podspec. Locally, you could resolve this issue by running `pod update RCT-Folly --no-repo-update`. On the CI, you have to do a clean checkout (in case you cache the `Pods` folder which we do). All of this makes upgrading `react-native` painful - for the whole community and for us @shopify

There are other users who have struggled with this, such as [here](LINK The suggestion there is to delete `Podfile.lock` which is unnecessary - but it shows that users are confused what to do with this error and is something worth fixing.

To mitigate these issues, `react_native_pods.rb` automatically marks `RCT-Folly` as changed in the [detect_changes_with_podfile method](LINK from `Pod::Lockfile` if the version in `node_modules/react-native/third-party-podspecs/RCT-Folly.podspec` and `Pods/Local Podspecs/RCT-Folly.podspec.json` mismatch. 

Instead of automatically updating the local podspec (in `Pods/Local Podspecs` directory) we could also:
a) integrate `RCT-Folly` as a local pod (such as `React-Core` and others)
b) integrate `RCT-Folly` as an external dependency (going through Cocoapods' centralized repository)

I don't have enough context on why `RCT-Folly` is bundled the way it is, so I am open to suggestions here.

[iOS] [Fixed] - Fix `pod install` when `RCT-Folly` version has been updated.

## Test Plan

I have created a [repository](LINK where you can reproduce the issue. You can simply:
1) clone the repo (`git clone LINK
2) Run `yarn install && cd ios && pod install`
3) Change `react-native` version in `package.json` to `0.66.3`
4) Run again `yarn install && pod install`
5) Observe error

To test the fix, you can then:
1) copy-paste the `react_native_pods.rb` file from this branch to `react-native-upgrade-reproduction/node_modules/scripts/react_native_pods.rb`
2) run `pod install` again

This time, the `pod install` command should succeed.

That PR builds upon the `CellRenderMask` data structure added with LINK and VirtualizedList coverage added with LINK The first commit can be skipped to review this change independently.

This change makes VirtualizedList track the last focused cell, through the capture phase of `onFocus`. It will keep the last focus cell, and its neighbors rendered.

We keep the last focused rendered even if blurred for the scenario of tabbing in and and out of the VirtualizedList.

940,facebook/react-native,NickGerleman,Enable Generic Discontiguous Regions within VirtualizedList,"## Summary

This builds upon the `CellRenderMask` data structure added with LINK and VirtualizedList coverage added with LINK to allow more discontinuous structures in VirtualizedList. This enables keyboard/a11y scenarios, where focus may be outside of a viewport-derived region.

VirtualizedList currently keeps a [first, last] range as state, tracking the region of cells to render. The render functions uses this as an input, along with a few special cases to render more (sticky headers, initial render region.)

This change moves to instead keep state which describes discontinuous render regions. This mask is continually updated as the viewport changes, batch renders expand the region, etc. Special cases are baked into the render mask, with a relatively simple transformation from the mask to render function.

MS/FB folks have a video discussion about VirtualizedList here: LINK

941,facebook/react-native,peterc1731,feat: support queuing accessibility announcements on ios,"## Summary

The current implementation of `AccessibilityInfo.announceForAccessibility` will immediately interrupt any existing in progress speech with the announcement. Sometimes this is desirable behaviour, but often you will want to wait until existing speech is finished before reading the new announcement. This change gives us that option.

My personal use case for this feature is a custom text input. When typing on iOS with voiceover enabled, each character is read out after being selected. I wanted to add some additional information after each character to help with the context of what has changed in the input, but I didn't want to override the reading of the character itself.

This feature is supported natively on iOS by constructing an `NSAttributedString` with the property [`accessibilitySpeechQueueAnnouncement`](LINK so this change just adds an extra parameter to `AccessibilityInfo.announceForAccessibility` which controls the value of that property on the native side. Adding this as an extra optional parameter with false as the default ensures that existing uses of the function won't be affected.

Unfortunately, this feature doesn't appear to be supported on Android, so the new second property will be iOS only.

## Changelog

[iOS] [Added] - add new argument to announceForAccessibility to allow queueing on iOS

## Test Plan

I've updated the `announceForAccessibility` section in RNTester with multiple buttons to demonstrate the difference between `queue: false` (default) and `queue: true` and show they work as intended.

Here's the expectation for each button:

- ""Announce for Accessibility Immediately"": on press, should start reading the button label, then be interrupted by the announcement
- ""Announce for Accessibility Queued"": on press, should read the button label then read the announcement afterwards
- ""Announce for Accessibility Queue Multiple"": on press, should read the button label, then read three announcements sequentially, no interruptions

You can see the realisation of those expectations in the following video recorded on an iPhone 12 running iOS 15.0.2:

I've also tested the same way on an iPhone 8 running iOS 13.4 and it works exactly the same.

975,facebook/react-native,lunaleaps,Fix npm latest tag issue when releasing patches,"Summary:
Changelog: [Internal] Fix npm `latest` tag issue that occurs when we release a patch on an older minor version

Context:
* There are two types of tags, git and npm, they are unrelated.

* When we publish a stable release, we set the git tag `latest`. This logic is faulty when we release a patch to an older version.

* When publishing a package to npm, if you don't provide an explicit tag, the `latest` tag will be applied -- at least that's how I've understood the [docs here](LINK This again is faulty logic when we release a patch to an older version.

* npm and git's `latest` tag should always point to our most recent stable version

This change:
* Introduces a `--latest` flag for `bump-oss-script` that will indicate that the release we're running (either a stable or pre-release) should really be considered ""latest""
* If the version is not a pre-release and the `--latest` flag is set, we will set the git `latest` tag
* Later, in the circleCI job that we use to publish the npm package, we will see if the current commit is git-tagged as `latest`. If it is, then we'll explicitly tell npm to use `latest` tag but most importantly, if it's not, we'll set a tag of the form `{major}.{minor}-stable`.
* This type of tag (ex. `0.66-stable`) is new and the intention is that it will always point to latest of that minor version.

We appreciate you spending the time to work on these changes. Please provide enough information so that others can review your pull request. The three fields below are mandatory. -->

## Summary

The stock new app template is not Android-12 compatible, and I did not notice any issues or PRs opened for it when I searched, though I may have missed it? So I'm proposing what I think are the necessary changes so new apps work on Android 12 out of the box

## Changelog

[Android] [Fixed] - updated new app template and rn-tester for Android 12 support

## Test Plan

1. Check out my branch
2. Make a temporary edit to `template/package.json` to replace react-native version `1000.0.0` with `0.67.0-rc.2`
3. Make a temporary edit to `template/android/app/src/debug/.../ReactNativeFlipper.java` to revert this change which makes ReactNativeFlipper incompatible with the react-native 0.67-0-rc.2 release (LINK
3. `npx react-native init Android12Test --template git@github.com:mikehardy/react-native.git#android12`
4. `cd Android12Test && npx react-native run-android`

Those test steps worked for me

I assume rn-tester is tested in CI? If not it will clearly work or clearly blow up when run, but I did check locally:

1. Check out my branch
2. `yarn install`
3. `./gradlew :packages:rn-tester:android:app:installJscDebug` (this is where it would fail if there was a problem)
4. `./scripts/packager.sh`
5. start the app on the device - it all seems to work

Note that I am able to pop up the android debug settings (the DevSupportActivity) with `ctrl-M` on linux but I am simply not able to get the emulator shake to bring it up with exported:true or exported:false. Just in case, and since it is debug only I labeled that activity exported:true to make sure it could be called if needed.

If someone with more knowledge of how and when DevSupportActivity is used in the ecosystem it may be possible to have this as exported:false safely.",1
977,facebook/react-native,robbie-c,"Add support for ""preferred"" AlertButton","## Summary

Currently, with the Alert API on iOS, the only way to bold one of the buttons is by setting the style to ""cancel"". This has the side-effect of moving it to the left. The underlying UIKit API has a way of setting a ""preferred"" button, which does not have this negative side-effect, so this PR wires this up.

See preferredAction on UIAlertController LINK

Docs PR: LINK

## Changelog

[iOS] [Added] - Support setting an Alert button as ""preferred"", to emphasize it without needing to set it as a ""cancel"" button.

## Test Plan

I ran the RNTesterPods app and added an example. It has a button styled with ""preferred"" and another with ""cancel"", to demonstrate that the ""preferred"" button takes emphasis over the ""cancel"" button.

- A label named ""Version: unspecified"" must be created;
- The GitHub action to create labels will only run when there's a new release or if one is edited, it will then create all the other labels bases on the previous releases until it encounters one that already exists.

The current warning assumes the ruby binary to be single arch, but the ruby version shipping with macOS is universal `universal.arm64e-darwin20`. This PR changes the check to search for `arm64` in any position instead of just the beginning to fix false positives.

995,facebook/react-native,rayzr522,[iOS] Fix build of glog & Flipper-Glog on Apple Silicon,"## Summary

This is a fixed version of the #32380 PR. It solves a typo, prevents variable substitution in the patch file, and moves it to a better place in the script so that CURRENT_ARCH is actually detected before checking whether to patch.

The `config.sub` included in glog is too old and does not recognize `arm64-*` as a valid arch when building. This, combined with an out of date Flipper-Glog version, results in persistent build failures on Apple Silicon machines.

p.s. i assume all the podfile lock changes were caused by me running this on an Apple Silicon Mac, and thus all the pod checksums were run against the arm64 versions of those pods rather than the normal x86_64 versions. if this is an issue I can revert the changes to that file, but it would seem to be an inevitable issue in future PR diffs...

## Changelog

- [iOS] [Fixed] - Apple Silicon builds of glog & Flipper-Glog

- Clone this branch on both an Apple Silicon- & Intel-based Mac

Before LINK finding a system font used to return early. In order to allow variants, the referenced patch removed the early return so that variants could be applied later. However, there is no need to find the closest font as we already selected the proper system font. This also fixes a bug with setting a custom font handler via RCTSetDefaultFontHandler whos return could get overwritten by the closest font search.

Added an API to check if the app is hidden on macOS. This is a distinct state from the app _windows_ being hidden, and can be used to implement unique behaviour on activation. It is also useful in conjunction with `NSWindow.canHide`, which I will introduce in a follow-up MR if there are no objections.

1037,electron/electron,ppontes,chore: cherry-pick 855df1837e from chromium,"sandbox: Fix sandbox inheritance [M96 merge]

This is a cherry-pick of the following patch:
LINK

Patch description:
------------------
When creating a new frame and the initial empty document, blink was only
sending the frame's sandbox attribute, but without combining with its owner's
(=document) sandbox flags.

This patch combines frame's attribute with its document sandbox flags.

🎁 Arthur Sonzogni wishes for a better future: 🎁
-------------------------------------------------
There are no good reasons sandbox flags inheritance to be complicated.
See: content/browser/renderer_host/sandbox_flags.md

For legacy reasons, Chrome's developers were confused about what objects
have frame or document semantic. On the browser process, the
FrameTreeNode represents the frame and the RenderFrameHost is almost
(%RenderDocument) the document/execution-context.

Currently, sandbox flags is plumbed inside FramePolicy, and it is not
clear to me whether FramePolicy is a frame-scoped or document-scoped
property (or both).
The current logic speak about ""pending"" FramePolicy (=frame) and
""active"" FramePolicy (=document) and store both type into the
FrameTreeNode and RenderFrameHost, which is not ideal.

I believe we should extract SandboxFlags outside of FramePolicy and

restricted at the frame level, similar to CSP embedded enforcement.

1038,electron/electron,ppontes,chore: cherry-pick 855df1837e from chromium,"sandbox: Fix sandbox inheritance [M96 merge]

This is a cherry-pick of the following patch:
LINK

Patch description:
------------------
When creating a new frame and the initial empty document, blink was only
sending the frame's sandbox attribute, but without combining with its owner's
(=document) sandbox flags.

This patch combines frame's attribute with its document sandbox flags.

🎁 Arthur Sonzogni wishes for a better future: 🎁
-------------------------------------------------
There are no good reasons sandbox flags inheritance to be complicated.
See: content/browser/renderer_host/sandbox_flags.md

For legacy reasons, Chrome's developers were confused about what objects
have frame or document semantic. On the browser process, the
FrameTreeNode represents the frame and the RenderFrameHost is almost
(%RenderDocument) the document/execution-context.

Currently, sandbox flags is plumbed inside FramePolicy, and it is not
clear to me whether FramePolicy is a frame-scoped or document-scoped
property (or both).
The current logic speak about ""pending"" FramePolicy (=frame) and
""active"" FramePolicy (=document) and store both type into the
FrameTreeNode and RenderFrameHost, which is not ideal.

I believe we should extract SandboxFlags outside of FramePolicy and
make a very clean implementation, parallel to the PolicyContainer logic.
In a second step it could also be integrated into PolicyContainer, if we
resolve the additional property that sandbox flags can also be further
restricted at the frame level, similar to CSP embedded enforcement.

1094,electron/electron,miniak,chore: add ELECTRON_ prefix to C++ include guards,"#### Description of Change
C++ include guards should be relative to the root `src` directory, not just `src/electron` to make sure they are globally unique.

After #31156 we are having issues with our internal Electron builds, where we are adding 'src/microsoft' to the roots in `script/lint.js`. Incorrect guards are being generated for our files (`ICROSOFT_` instead of `MICROSOFT_`):
```
../microsoft/src/base/manual_delay_load.h:5: #ifndef header guard has wrong style, please use: ICROSOFT_SRC_BASE_MANUAL_DELAY_LOAD_H_ [build/header_guard] [5]
../microsoft/src/base/manual_delay_load.h:233: #endif line should be ""#endif // ICROSOFT_SRC_BASE_MANUAL_DELAY_LOAD_H_"" [build/header_guard] [5]
```
Passing `--project_root=src` instead of `--project_root=src/electron` fixes that.
Modifying `script/lint.js` to pass a different `--project_root=` for our files is complicated due to the way the code is written.

Before #31156 it worked as we have `src/microsoft/.git`. However the include guards started with `SRC_` instead of `MICROSOFT_SRC_`, which would make more sense (we have `src/microsoft/src`, which is equivalent of `src/electron/shell`).

1109,labuladong/fucking-algorithm,DerivedMate,[English] Correct Edit Distance,"(I feel a need to preface this by saying that the changes I made were based solely on the English version, and the reading experience, for I do not speak Chinese (I'm not even sure if it's Mandarin, Cantonese or which one, nor if there's any difference in writing). Should you object to any changes, please let me know)

1. Changed the apostrophe character from \` to '. The former is not used as an apostrophe, and is actually an accent mark (for preferred characters, refer to [this](LINK (U+0027 ', U+2019 ’, U+201B ‛)).
2. Changed certain verb forms. For instance: *""The last question is that **writing** a function to calculate [...]""* to *""The last question is **to write** a function which calculates [...]""* (also *which* -> *to* in order to avoid the repetition).
3. Changed the capitalization where necessary. For example: *Helpless* to *helpless* (since it's not a proper name); *We* to *we* (middle of a sentence).
4. Changed a few verbs to nouns, and vice versa: *""explain""* (on its own serves as an imperative, which would demand that the reader explain it) to *""explanation""*; *""storage""* to ""store [the least editing distance of s1 and s2; L226]"".
5. Fixed redundant spaces: *""[...] `s2`  in [...]""* to *""[...] `s2` in [...]""*; *""s1[i]！=s2[j]""* to *""s1[i] != s2[j]""*
6. Changed a few odd phrases: *""a violent solution""* to *""a brute force solution""* ( [most](LINK albeit [not all](LINK uses of the former did not refer to programming ); *""from the bottom to up""* to *""from the bottom up""* (or *""bottom-up""*; see: [from the bottom up](LINK and [bottom-up](LINK ); *""operation number""* to *""the number of operations""* (this one might have been more subjective).
7. Removed latex dollar signs (since github markdown does not support it): *""$O(min(M, N))$""* to *""O(min(M, N))""* (as used in other articles).
8. Pluralized certain nouns after *""any""* ( [""We use any for indefinite quantities in questions and negative sentences""](LINK ): *""any operation""* to *""any operations""*.
9. Added some formatting: ""dp(i, j)"" to ""`dp(i, j)`"" (L98).

I'm also not sure if *""[...] I wrote some words out of place by mistake""* refers to mistyping, but it's still more than clear, albeit slightly wordy.

To reiterate, should any of these be of concern, let me know, especially since it is my second language.

两种非递归遍历树的代码风格统一方法


1.标识遍历法，就是要处理的节点放入栈之后，紧接着放入一个空指针作为标记。
此方法适合前中后遍历，通用。

public List<Integer> inorderTraversal(TreeNode root) {
        List<Integer> res = new ArrayList<>();
        Deque<TreeNode> stack = new LinkedList<>();

        while(!stack.isEmpty()){
            TreeNode node = stack.pop();
            if(node!=null){
                if(node.right!=null) stack.push(node.right);//右，注意此处是先把右结点压栈，先进后出
                stack.push(node);//中
                stack.push(null);//标记
                if(node.left!=null) stack.push(node.left);//左
            }else{// 只有遇到空节点的时候，才将下一个节点放进结果集
                node=stack.pop();
                res.add(node.val);
            }

There has been recent discussion indicating that an 8-month introductory course may be too ambitious for the OSSU program (including on the Discord channel and #785.) Meanwhile, many students on the Discord report being able to complete Py4E in substantially shorter time periods by increasing the amount of effort.

The 34 week course duration is estimated from an assumed 3 hours of effort per week. Other courses in the OSSU program assume 8-12 hours of effort per week. 

**Problem:** Assigning 3 hours of effort per week for our Py4E course is artificially inflating the perceived length of the course.

**Complication:** The course is truly self-paced, and progress can be made with as little as 3 hours of effort per week - should the student so choose.

**Proposed Solution:** Adjust the advertised level of effort to a nominal 10 weeks at a nominal 10 hours of effort per week, to put this course on parity with the introductory courses that follow it. Provide additional notation to clarify that the course is self-paced and the required level of effort can be adjusted to meet the student's needs.",2

1377,ossu/computer-science,aryzach,updated missing semester description,"I just 'finished' the course. I've taken 14 or so OSSU classes and found this very helpful and wish I'd taken it earlier (especially the Vim chapter). The class is laid out and meant to be completed in 11 class days and 18 calendar days. I half-heartedly tried to keep up with their schedule (videos and exercises), and found it somewhat impractical. The videos take 45 mins - 1 hour, and the exercises vary in number and time required. Roughly 2 - 10 exercises some taking 5 minutes while other could take 2+ hours. I often found I didn't have the programs installed, or that the exercise required me to do a bit of research to learn the tool. I'm on a Mac, and Linux might have more of these tools installed by default, but that's not something we can expect from students. Also, these are problems I'm running into after being an OSSU student for about 2 years. I wouldn't expect somebody just starting off working with computers / learning CS to be comfortable doing CLI stuff, and thus would likely take longer than me to do a lot of these tasks.

Two options: 
 - Increase the duration / effort from 2 weeks at 12hrs/week to 3 weeks at 15+hrs/week (but tbh, the time required is unbounded if you complete all exercises because of OS/system problems possible with some tools)
 - Include my description in this pull request (or similar wording). I think this option sticks with what this class was set out to be - an introduction and a resource, but not an end in itself

1401,facebook/create-react-app,dblazeski96,Add support for new ENTRY_PATH and PUBLIC_PATH advanced configuration variables,"## Summary

Add support for a new environment variables, `ENTRY_PATH` and `PUBLIC_PATH`, which may be used to override the default entry point `src/index` and the default public path `public`. It opens new possiblities for developing mini-apps within a container app without actually doing `eject`, hence almost **config-less** micro-frontend architecure.

> Configuring `PUBLIC_PATH` will also update the `index.html` path respectively

## Benefits

* The default behaviour is persisted.
* Can be configuired for a different entry point if you like it.
* Can be configuired for a different public path if you like it.
* Not doing `eject` for just a couple of paths (keeping the `package.json` clean)

If developing mini-apps are in mind

* Shared resources, all in one container app (configurations, rule-sets and even components)
* Great overview of the whole project
* Can be used in CI/CD build piplines
* Again not doing `eject`

## Examples

* ### Multiple **build** and **start** scripts for each mini-app

  > `ENTRY_PATH` configured for each mini-app

  ```json
  {
    ""scripts"": {
      ""start"": ""ENTRY_PATH=src/customer/index react-scripts start"",
      ""start:business"": ""ENTRY_PATH=src/business/index react-scripts start"",
      ""start:admin"": ""ENTRY_PATH=src/admin/index react-scripts start"",
    },
  }
  ```

  > `ENTRY_PATH` can be used in conjunction with `BUILD_PATH` for a nicer output structure

  ```json
  {
    ""scripts"": {
      ""build"": ""ENTRY_PATH=src/customer/index BUILD_PATH=build/customer react-scripts build"",
      ""build:business"": ""ENTRY_PATH=src/business/index BUILD_PATH=build/business react-scripts build"",
      ""build:admin"": ""ENTRY_PATH=src/admin/index BUILD_PATH=build/admin react-scripts build"",
    }
  }
  ```

  > `PUBLIC_PATH` used in conjunction with `ENTRY_PATH` and `BUILD_PATH`
  
  ```json
  {
    ""scripts"": {
      ""build"": ""ENTRY_PATH=src/customer/index PUBLIC_PATH=public/customer BUILD_PATH=build/customer react-scripts build"",
      ""build:business"": ""ENTRY_PATH=src/business/index PUBLIC_PATH=public/business BUILD_PATH=build/business react-scripts build"",
      ""build:admin"": ""ENTRY_PATH=src/admin/index PUBLIC_PATH=public/admin BUILD_PATH=build/admin react-scripts build"",
    }
  }
  ```

* ### Github Workflow

  ```yaml

    push:

Further investigation of the react-dev-utils found a similar scenario in redirectServedPathMiddleware. Both path.join calls were adjusted to path.posix.join to ensure that posix compliance is preserved in urls for both of these middleware, in their comparison or redirection.

1448,facebook/create-react-app,lukekarrys,Fail when create-react-app is used via a global install (#11473),"This checks for the existence of `process.env.npm_config_user_agent` to determine how `create-react-app` was invoked. If `npm_config_user_agent` is missing, the script will fail with an error message similar to 

It is still possible for `npx` to use a global or local install if one exists. In those cases, the `checkForLatestVersion` will cause it to fail if the user is not up to date.

Closes #11473 

To confirm that this was the best env var to check for I wrote a quick package that prints `npm_*` env vars when it is invoked, and ran it via `npx`, `yarn create`, `yarn dlx`, and when installed globally. The results of those are below if anyone is curious, but it `npm_config_user_agent` was the best choice (same as #11322).

1465,facebook/create-react-app,eungyeole,"fix: load config ""react-app"" error","Hello! Good morning.

I am studying Yarnberry these days. So I decided to use yarnberry for create-react-app.
After setting it up, I started with `yarn start`. However, it did not start with the following error:

```shell
Failed to compile

Failed to load config ""react-app"" to extend from.
Referenced from: /Users/an-eungyeol/Documents/yarn/normalreact/package.json
```
After seeing this error, I searched Google for it. And I found the (#10463) issue. 
This issue provided solutions to install eslint-config-react-app. So I added the module to the cra template. The number of users of Yarnberry seems to be increasing these days.
I really hope this PR to be received.

1468,facebook/create-react-app,nfriend,Serve the root index.html for all client-side routes when hosted in Netlify or GitLab Pages,"### What does this PR do?

Adds a `_redirects` file that allows client-side [`pushState`](LINK routing to work out of the box when deployed on [Netlify](LINK or [GitLab Pages](LINK

More details about the `_redirects` file can be found [here](LINK [Here's a section](LINK about this specific setup.

### Relevant `create-react-app` docs

LINK

### How to test

1. Create a new GitHub repo
1. Scaffold a new project using this PR's branch of `create-react-app`
1. Commit and push
1. Using a [Netlify](LINK account, connect Netlify to the new GitHub repo created in step <span>#</span>1
1. Use the default Netlify options to deploy the site
1. Verify that all URL routes result in the root `index.html` being served. For example, navigating to `LINK should look like this:
   <img width=""1261"" alt=""working"" src=""LINK

   In contrast, without the `_redirects` file, Netlify would serve up a 404 page:

   <img width=""1261"" alt=""not-working"" src=""LINK

The process for testing on GitLab Pages is similar, although it involves a few extra steps (setting up a `.gitlab-ci.yml` pipeline to publish a Pages site).",1

- The reduction in allocations has the additional benefit that the garbage collector runs less often, blocking WebAssembly's one and only thread less often

There should be no observable difference in the `syscall/js` API.

These changes have been discussed and mostly agreed upon in the linked issue.

1530,golang/go,rajbarik,pgo: profile-guided optimization for golang v1.17,"This PR implements profile-guided optimization for Golang v1.17. At a very high-level, our implementation consumes PPROF CPU profiles via the compiler flag '-fpprofprofileuse' and performs three key optimizations based on profiles: code specialization ('-specialize'), inlining ('-pprofinline'), code layout ('-codelayout'). Code specialization targets interface method calls to specialize them to direct function calls. Inlining decisions are made based on profiles. Codelayout optimization currently reorders functions based on profiles. BasicBlock layout optimization is currently WIP.

Inlining based on profiles yields decent wins (avg 15%, max 40%). 

For [bitset](LINK we see ~19% gain from inlining. Please find the steps below to reproduce:

when MIME type sniffing is performed. This can be somewhat surprising to an

type sniffing and therefore seeking). With FileServer, this results in a
""seeker can't seek"" message, which is not very clear for the developer.

does. Therefore, this change adds a line to the documentation of net/http's

1596,golang/go,dbussink,crypto/sha: implement SHA1 & SHA256 acceleration using Intel SHA extensions,"This change implements SHA1 & SHA256 acceleration using the Intel SHA
extensions if those instructions are enabled. First the internal/cpu
package needs support to detect the CPU extension flag for SHA extensions.

The crypto/sha256 package contains a small refactor so that it matches how
crypto/sha1 & crypto/sha512 are set up and it makes it easier to use
consistent code in how it's decided which implementation can be used based
on CPU support.

All the work here is based on the Intel reference documentation at
LINK
Using only the reference documentation avoids issue like in #27443 where
code from another project was converted to Go assembly.

The discussion in #27443 mentions that for SHA1 including this was
debatable, since the algorithm itself is no longer considered safe. I think
that a 2x performance improvement is still significant though and there's
still a lot of places where SHA1 is still used (for example for Git itself).
Of course the SHA1 change can be backed out if this change is only desired
for SHA256 because of that.

1599,golang/go,soatok,crypto/ecdsa: Adjust entropy bounds,"Matching the entropy for an ECDSA signature to the ECDLP attack cost of the curve might make intuitive sense, but the birthday bound for a random function is Q(sqrt(N)), so we're matching a square root of a square root. For P-224 (ECDLP security of 112 bits), this doesn't yield a birthday bound of 112 bits, it yields a birthday bound of **56 bits**.

This patch changes the formula to produce roughly double the expected entropy (by changing the divisor from `16` to `8`), while requiring at least 256 bits. In case of weird cure support, this patch also caps the entropy at 512 bits. The variability between the two will mostly be observed with curves in between the two bounds (i.e. NIST P-384, which many users expect to offer a 192-bit security level anyway).

1624,axios/axios,07akioni,Adding createDefaults method,"Related issue: LINK

Let me explain why the ability is needed.

We are using axios as request library in a component library which will send request to server with customized headers.

However, the consumers of our library change `axios.defaults` and it conflicts with our customized axios instance. As a result, our request is responded with server error due to incorrect headers.

Axios currently can't provide an unmodified defaults. If someone modified it, every other consumers will be influenced and we have no way to get the original copy useless we copy the source code from the repo.

Our current solution is very hack. We copied some source code from the repo and made our own `createInstance`. I don't want to keep the code in the final version, it will become a disaster in maintainability.

### Notes

1. I'm not sure source root is the best place to place the `createDefaults.js` file. Please leave some guide.
2. Maybe providing a pure version of `axios.create` is better way but I'm not sure with the API.

Allows to pass different type of axios config (modified AxiosRequestConfig) for axios.create. So code example below does not throw typescript error.

`axios.create({
  ...,
  headers: {
    get: { 'common-header-for-get': 'value' },
    'some-header-for-all-methods': 'value'
  },
});`

which works fine if using javascript lib version w/o typescript.

1660,axios/axios,DigitalBrainJS,Added optional ability for child instances to use actual parent config values,"Adds the ability to modify the inherited configuration of child instances, by changing parent configuration (only if an instance was created with `useLiveConfig` option). This feature uses a prototype inheritance via 
```js
instanceConfig= Object.create(parentConfig)
```
So, we got a deep configuration object. But when we make a request, it is converted to a ""flat"" configuration object, so transform handlers and interceptors continue to work with the standard configuration representation, nothing changes here.

In addition:
- The `setConfig(configPatch)` & `getConfig(void)` methods have been added to work with instance configuration.
- Setting defaults for the root axios instance no longer affects the default internal config object.

Code example:
```js
const root = axios.create({
  headers: {
    myHeader1: ""foo""
  }
}, false);

const liveInstance = root.create(
  {
    headers: {
      myHeader2: 'bar'
    }
  },
  true // <<- inherit parent config in ""live mode""
);

const typicalInstance = root.create(
  {
    headers: {
      myHeader2: 'bar2'
    }
  }
);

root.setConfig({
  headers: {
    myHeader1: ""baz"",
    newHeader: ""qux""
  }
});

root.setConfig({
  headers:{
    myHeader1: ""newValue""
  }
});


console.log('root', root.getConfig().headers); // {myHeader1: 'newValue', newHeader: 'qux', ...}
console.log('static: ', typicalInstance.getConfig().headers); // {myHeader1: 'foo', myHeader2: 'bar2', ...}
console.log('live', liveInstance.getConfig().headers); // {myHeader1: 'newValue', newHeader: 'qux', myHeader2: 'bar'}

Node.js 12 is in maintenance and goes End-of-Life next April (2022). This pull request is to attempt to fix the GitHub actions macOS workflow by pinning the runner to the macOS version we were previously testing on before GitHub updated what `macos-latest` points to,

If this doesn't work I'd propose dropping this workflow from `v12.x` -- I briefly looked at the Python 3 PRs that landed in the later release lines and I would not be comfortable attempting to backport those to `v12.x` this late in its lifecycle.

This is the implementation of LINK as discussed at the last Loaders meeting (cc @nodejs/loaders). I leave it as draft because I expect to get feedback that could change the design, but it's already in a working state and I'd appreciate reviews. This PR includes:

- A new `getFileSystem` hook lets user interact with the Node resolution by letting them override the code I/O dependencies of the resolution algorithms. Four functions have been ported, in both async and sync versions (look below for a more detailed sync/async discussion).

    - Unlike [my initial plans for a `readFile` hook](LINK which would have implied to eventually create other hooks for `statFile` etc, this implementation takes a different approach by defining a single hook which must return an interface of utilities. This approach works better in my opinion:
    
      - It's more scalable; more filesystem utilities can be added without having to make them full-blown hooks, which would imo needlessly complexify the design (if only in terms of documentation; with `getFileSystem`, the filesystem utilities can be documented in a different place than the proper hooks).
      
      - Filesystem utilities are very connected to each other. As a result, it stands to reason some hook author would want to return one set of utilities or another based on various conditions (for example we could imagine a loader that would allow disabling its features by returning the default filesystem utilities if a certain environment variable is set). If each utility was its own hook, this would be convoluted to achieve.
  
      - It also addresses the concerns @GeoffreyBooth had by avoiding to entangle the hook calls: the `getFileSystem` hook is only called when Node boots, not from within other hooks (the filesystem utilities themselves will be called during the hooks execution, of course, but it seems to be this shouldn't be a problem as those functions should be assumed to have no visible side effect).
      
    - The hook already implements the four utilities currently required for the Node resolution. I remember we discussed doing only `readFile` as a demo before adding the other ones, but I realized when implementing it that some things would appear over-engineered if I didn't show an example that used multiple utilities (for example, having `getFileSystem` that returns an object would make no sense if we only needed `readFile` - but we don't, which makes a design like `getFileSystem` more valuable).

    - I made the utilities have the exact same return values as the Node core functions they replaced (in particular for `internalModuleStat` and `InternalModuleReadJSON`, which have unusual return types). I'm open to ideas as to how the utility signatures should be for the final version.
 
    - I however normalised all utilities' inputs so that they all take a `URL` instance as parameter. In many case it just meant reusing url instances, and only in a few places I needed to instantiate new ones.

- The `demo/` folder is of course temporary and just meant to discuss how the hook looks like in practice. For this example, I implemented a loader that, given a file `foo.mjs` (or any other name), simulates the existence of a `foo-sha512.mjs` file that exports the hash of the original file). I picked this example because it's easy to conceptualise, and cannot be achieved by the other hooks.

    - I considered writing a ""load modules from http"" loader, but it's a little more difficult due to the Node algorithms currently relying a lot on synchronous operations, even in the esm pipeline. It would still have been possible with workers and atomics, but I felt like this would be better avoided for a simple demo use case.

  - I didn't write tests or documentation yet; those will be written once I un-draft the PR. For now, the `demo/` folder can be seen as the reference on how to use and experiment with the PR.

## Async vs sync

I initially implemented all the filesystem utilities as async functions, but quickly noticed that the Node resolution (even in the esm pipeline) was relying on them being sync. After some thoughts, I decided to implement both versions, even if some of them aren't in use right now. There are a few reasons for that:

- I didn't want to rework the entirety of the Node resolution pipeline. Changing sync functions to become async was a no-goal for me, especially considering the other points that follow.

- The loader implementation cost of having to write two different versions of a same hook can be offset by Node automatically reusing the sync version of an utility if the same loader declares it (check my demo loader for an example).

- There's a decent case that the cjs resolution pipeline could benefit from the `getFileSystem` hooks as well, which would allow us to close LINK This is something I'd like to tackle once the current task is done, so I don't think it'd hurt to document both sync and async utilities and suggest implementers implement both.

1955,nodejs/node,sxa,Modify configure to explain how to bypass python version check if required.,"As new versions of python come out it's possible that a user will be using a later one than our supported list. This PR adds the message in that situation telling people how they can bypass the check and to encourage raising an issue/PR to support the new version if it works. It also adds information about the lowest supported version with an indication that earlier ones are unlikely to work (I could just remove this check, but it's good to be nice to users!)

I don't think this will be too controversial unless there is an objection to the new lines not being wrapped at <80 characters :-)

1956,nodejs/node,jasnell,lib: make AbortSignal cloneable/transferable,"Refs: LINK

Allows for using `AbortSignal` across worker threads and contexts.

```js
const ac = new AbortController();
const mc = new MessageChannel();
mc.port1.onmessage = ({ data }) => {
  data.addEventListener('abort', () => {
    console.log('aborted!');
  });
};
mc.port2.postMessage(ac.signal, [ac.signal]);
```

Having to include the `AbortSignal` in the transfer list here is a side effect of our current implementation. We use `js_transferable` under the covers and use a pair of `MessagePort`s to communicate between the two `AbortSignal`s. Using `[kClone]()`, there's no way for us to specify that the `MessagePort` should be included in the transfer list as the `[kTransferList]` method is not called when using `[kClone]()`. So, we end up having to use `[kTransfer]()` which requires that the `AbortSignal` be included in the transfer list. (/cc @addaleax)

1957,nodejs/node,Trott,tools: remove Babel from license-builder.sh,"Babel is now installed as a dependency in our ESLint installation. The
current license-builder.sh will fail to find the license for Babel.

The license is sill present in the repository/code base/file system. So
as with all other dependencies that are installed in
tools/node_modules/eslint/node_modules and have an MIT license, we are
still complying with the license. The inclusion in our own LICENSE was
to clearly signal that things under tools/node_modules/@babel were not
covered by the Node.js license. Because it is now under
tools/node_modules/eslint, that ""we aren't the license-holders of this
code"" aspect of things is already covered by the inclusion of the ESLint
license.

Looking at the code that looked right but removing the

Looking more closely it seems like we were not allocating

1970,nodejs/node,bnb,doc: add styleguide,"This PR adds a documentation style guide. This comes as a result of LINK and the various next-10 discussions that led to it. It is _largely_ a copy/paste from electron/electron's [styleguide.md](LINK with some changes.

The goal of this is not to have it as an immediately enforceable, but rather to have it be planted as the guide that we'll eventually fully enforce on all documentation that it can be enforced on (some documentation, like native APIs, it can only be partially enforced on).

Landing this and, eventually, having all of our documentation written in this style should allows us the ability to use [docs-parser](LINK which produces a high-quality JSON output of markdown documentation written as the style guide defines. This would allow the DefinitelyTyped people to produce higher quality type definitions, potentially even just using Electron's [typescript-definitions](LINK tooling that parses docs-parser output into `.d.ts` files.

There are other, less objective benefits:
- highly consistent authoring experience that provides a consistent framework for writing and reviewing documentation
- more digestible documentation for end-users, structuring all documentation in a hierarchy that's consistent across pages while still being specific enough to provide meaningful context regardless of content

Worth noting, I also created LINK some time ago, and this is one step towards that as a reality. In doing so, I also created [bnb/node-docs-parser](LINK which snapshotted a few examples from the Node.js documentation at the time I created it and provided an example of what those documents would look like if they were migrated. While it's been a pandemic worth of time since I last worked on that repo and some of the docs have been updated (querystring in particular is much more consistent!), the documents in `/docs/api` are still pretty close to what the ""translated"" versions would look like if you want a reference.

changes to the styleguide.md from the e/e version include:

- updating the name (`Electron` > `Node.js`)
- removing references to `markdownlint`
  - given that Electron and docs-parser use markdownlint, it might make sense to migrate to it.
- removed a TODO above the linter rules, noting that they should be checked against what the electron/electron markdown parser checks for.
  - potentially worth investigating finding a middle ground and both using one set of tooling.
- tweaked examples to fit Node.js. As we build out the documentation to fit this style guide, we should update these examples to me more thorough.
- removed one example under the ""function signature"" heading on line 169, as I'm not immediately familiar of a class that has the same name as its module and can be used as an example. Happy to re-add this when I find a good example.
  - here's the original text, for reference: 
    - > For example, the methods of the `Session` class under the `session` module must use `ses` as the `objectName`.
- removed a reference on line 181 to Electron's cookie API custom sturcutre. Happy to re-add this back in once we've got our own custom structures added.
- added backticks to line 228 where they weren't in the Electron documentation. I believe the backticks are allowed/required, but should double check just to make sure that's a correct assertion before merging.

a few things to discuss:
- js code linting
  - Electron's standardized on StandardJS and has proper tooling for it, including [standard-markdown](LINK While I'm personally fine with this, I assume the Node.js project would want a different linter solution documented.
  - happy to change the text on lines 55-56 referencing this if we don't want to keep this.
- I'm not sure if we have platform-specific functionality. If we don't and never plan on doing so, happy to remove line 194-203.
- how we want to approach inline YAML changelogs. Particularly, it was raised that it would be nice to have in Markdown but it may also become burdensome for those who backport, which is definitely not something I'd want to see.
  - potential solution here is to document an additional markdown structure for changelogs and then have a small tool convert YAML into that Markdown structure as a build step.
  - I'm unopinionated on what a solution is here, but ideally, we will *eventually* not have any YAML frontmatter.

and just for context, the ideal next steps _after_ this PR lands would be to begin incrementally migrating documentation to fit the style guide.",7

2002,kubernetes/kubernetes,julianvmodesto,Re-introduce removed kubectl --dry-run values.,"#### What type of PR is this?
/kind cleanup

#### What this PR does / why we need it:

For 1.23, we removed the kubectl `--dry-run` empty default value (`--dry-run`)
and boolean values (`--dry-run=true` and `--dry-run=false`). This change
required requiring users to specify `--dry-run=client` or `--dry-run=server`
due to a deprecation. This change was made in #105327.

After reconsideration, this change is not worth the churn for users.
It's likely that many users rely on these values for automated and manual use
cases.

This change reverts #105327 and re-introduces the values `--dry-run`,
`--dry-run=true`, and `--dry-run=false`.

This change should be picked for the next patch release of 1.23.

#### What this PR does / why we need it:
The idea comes from the java high-performance [arraydeque](LINK array. When using cyclic array, there will be a lot of `%` operations, and the use of `&` will have a better performance.

Here are performance comparison data：
```bash
goos: darwin
goarch: amd64
pkg: k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/storage/cacher
cpu: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-8210Y CPU @ 1.60GHz
BenchmarkWatchCache_updateCache-4       79304628                13.04 ns/op
BenchmarkWatchCache_updateCacheOld-4    30225078                36.73 ns/op
PASS
ok      k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/storage/cacher     23.059s

```
`a%b` == `a&(b-1)` require: b=2^n,  so watchCache cyclic array capacity must be 2^n

2019,kubernetes/kubernetes,pohly,RFC: log message verbosity,"#### What type of PR is this?

/kind bug

#### What this PR does / why we need it:

In the following code pattern, the log message will get logged with v=0 in JSON
output although conceptually it has a higher verbosity:

```    
       if klog.V(5).Enabled() {
           klog.Info(""hello world"")
       }
```
    
Having the actual verbosity in the JSON output is relevant, for example for
filtering out only the important info messages. The solution is to use
`klog.V(5).Info` or something similar.
    
Whether the outer if is necessary at all depends on how complex the parameters
are. If the goal is to only format certain parameters if needed, then
`klog.AsText` or `klog.As` can be used to delay the expensive work until the
parameter is really needed.
    
The return value of `klog.V` can be captured in a variable and be used multiple
times to avoid the overhead for that function call.

#### Which issue(s) this PR fixes:
Related-to: LINK

#### Special notes for your reviewer:

A new klog release is needed before this PR can be used. Until then it serves as a proof-of-concept for the new klog functions.

This PR is also not complete yet. `git grep 'klog.V([0-9]*).Enabled' cmd/ pkg/ staging` can be used to find code locations that may have to be modified.

#### Does this PR introduce a user-facing change?
```release-note
Some log messages were logged with `""v"":0` in JSON output although they are debug messages with a higher verbosity.

/kind cleanup

#### What this PR does / why we need it:

Currently when the dockershim socket is used, kubeadm only passes
the --network-plugin=cni to the kubelet and assumes the built-in
dockershim. This is valid for versions <1.24, but with dockershim
and related flags removed the kubelet will fail.

Use preflight.GetKubeletVersion() to find the version of the host
kubelet and if the version is <1.24 assume that it has built-in
dockershim. Newer versions should will be treated as ""remote"" even
if the socket is for dockershim, for example, provided by cri-dockerd.

Update related unit tests.

kubeadm: handle the removal of dockershim and related flags for new kubeadm clusters. If kubelet <1.24 is on the host, kubeadm >=1.24 will continue using the built-in dockershim in the kubelet. If kubelet version >=1.24 is on the host, kubeadm >=1.24 will set the dockershim socket as ""remote"" using the kubelet flags ""--container-runtime=remote --container-runtime-endpoint=/var/run/dockershim.sock"". This is how container runtimes like cri-o and containerd work today. This allows dockershim to be treated as a ""remote"" CRI implementation, if for example the socket is managed by cri-dockerd. For existing clusters during upgrade, users have to manually update the flags in the ""/var/lib/kubelet/kubeadm-flags.env"" file.

2027,kubernetes/kubernetes,ncdc,Code generation outside GOPATH,"/kind cleanup

#### What this PR does / why we need it:

Add support for the generators in k8s.io/code-generator to output generated files anywhere and not just in GOPATH.

The updated version of k8s.io/gengo now supports a `--trim-path-prefix` flag to trim a prefix from a generated file's path before creating it. This can be passed to the `generate-groups.sh` script in k8s.io/code-generator. For example, if you're generating code for github.com/foo/bar, and you have it cloned somewhere not in GOPATH, you can do this:

```
generate-groups.sh \
  all \
  github.com/foo/bar/pkg/client \
  github.com/foo/bar/pkg/apis \
  myapi:v1alpha1 \
  --trim-path-prefix github.com/foo/bar
```

and the generated files will essentially be written relative to the current directory (assuming it's the root of your repo). So github.com/foo/bar/pkg/client will be written to just pkg/client/... and so on.

#### What type of PR is this?

/kind bug

Optionally add one or more of the following kinds if applicable:

#### What this PR does / why we need it:

There is a race condition between PodWorkers.podSyncStatuses and k8s API server state if all containers of a Pod are finished while PodWorkers processes the Pod event(updateType=0(SyncPodWork)).
Details:
LINK

I updated `filterOutInactivePods` logic to filter additional pods to get active pods.
Terminal pods should be always considered inactive since k8s scheduler may consider them inactive.
This is needed to avoid insufficient resources errors like `OutOfCpu` when kubelet admits new pods.

We couldn't reproduce the race condition in kubernetes 1.21.2 cluster.
We found this issue in kubernetes 1.22.4 and release-1.22 branch(13fe78d2c9df0ec862ccb374998943a793a5efa0).

#### What this PR does / why we need it:
HNS returns an error while plumbing the LB policy if the endpoints list is empty. This is an expected failure and kube-proxy should have never attempted to plumb an HNS LB policy with empty endpoints. Kubeproxy is failing to mark the service as ""Applied"" because of this failure. In the next iteration of syncProxyRules, kubeproxy tries to re-apply the service (i.e., create the corresponding HNS LB policy with empty endpoints) which is bound to fail and the service is stuck in this failure loop and never marked as ""Applied"". 

This behavior has a potential to cause  syncProxyRules to execute for a long period (if a considerable number of services need to be re-applied on every syncProxyRules iteration), which in turn can cause flapping in service connectivity .

2064,kubernetes/kubernetes,stevekuznetsov,WIP: client-go: generation based mutation cache,"client-go: expose a generic comparison interface

The ResourceVersion of an object is meant to be entirely opaque,
allowing only equality checks on the client side. The mutation cache
should therefore expose a comparison interface that does not expect to
be using forbidden mechanisms for comparison.

Signed-off-by: Steve Kuznetsov <skuznets@redhat.com>

---

client-go: allow using generations in mutation cache

If a controller is setting the status.observedGeneration to indicate how
recently it has reacted to the spec of an object, the mutation cache can
track mutations almost as well as with the resourceVersion. In all cases
where the observedGeneration in the mutation is newer than the
generation from the lister, we know that the mutation is newer. When the
two are identical, we cannot tell if the objects are at identical
versions or if the status has been updated without bumping the observed
generation, but we know at the very least that we can use the object
from the lister as it is at least as new as that in the mutation. If the
generation in the lister is newer, we know that the lister's object is
newer.

2068,kubernetes/kubernetes,aojea,Client go metrics,"/kind bug
/kind cleanup
/kind feature

#### What this PR does / why we need it:

To understand the network health of the cluster we need to have good metrics, for http requests is good to have latency and request size.

This PR adds request size metrics to client-go, uses a new histogram bucket for latency so users can have better visibility on requests with high latency and fixes the logic to obtain the metrics to consider only the requests that are able to connect to the server.

```release-note
client-go metrics: 
- add new metric rest_client_request_size_bytes.
- change bucket distribution for rest_client_request_duration_seconds and rest_client_rate_limiter_duration_seconds so they can have more granularity on requests with high latency.
- only get latency and request size metrics for requests that reach the server.
```

An example of current buckets used for latency shows the problem of capping it to .512 seconds, we loose visibility on the high values and I think we don't need such granularity on the low values

2073,kubernetes/kubernetes,tsmetana,mount-utils: Detect potential stale file handle,"#### What type of PR is this?

/kind bug

#### What this PR does / why we need it:

This is a fix for the issue #97031. It may happen that a subpath mount point on a networking FS gets deleted on the server but in the case of some file systems (CIFS) it would make the stat syscall end with ENOENT, preventing the mount point to be cleaned up and pods using the mount can't be cleanly deleted.

This situation can be detected by calling also access syscall on the same path: if there is a discrepancy between stat and access results, treating the mount as corrupted allows for successful cleanup and unmount.

#### Which issue(s) this PR fixes:
Fixes #97031

There exists is another attempt to fix the same problem that doesn't work. It was the discussion in the following PR that lead to this one: LINK

```release-note
Reverts graceful node shutdown to match 1.21 behavior of setting pods that have not yet successfully completed to ""Failed"" phase if the GracefulNodeShutdown feature is enabled in kubelet. The GracefulNodeShutdown feature is beta and must be explicitly configured via kubelet config to be enabled in 1.21+. This changes 1.22 and 1.23 behavior on node shutdown to match 1.21. If you do not want pods to be marked terminated on node shutdown in 1.22 and 1.23, disable the GracefulNodeShutdown feature.

2081,kubernetes/kubernetes,neolit123,kubeadm: validate local etcd certficates during expiration checks,"#### What type of PR is this?

/kind bug

#### What this PR does / why we need it:

```
kubeadm: validate local etcd certficates during expiration checks 

In case stacked etcd is used, the code that does expiration checks
does not validate if the etcd CA is ""external"" (missing key)
and if the etcd CA signed certificates are valid.

Add a new function UsingExternalEtcdCA() similar to existing functions
for the cluster CA and front-proxy CA, that performs the checks for
missing etcd CA key and certificate validity.

This function only runs for stacked etcd, since if etcd is external
kubeadm does not track any certs signed by that etcd CA.

This fixes a bug where the etcd CA will be reported as local even
if the etcd/ca.key is missing during ""certs check-expiration"".
```

this second commit is a cleanup on the side...

```
kubeadm: print the CA of kubeconfig files in ""check expiration"" 

Apply a small fix to ensure the kubeconfig files
that kubeadm manages have a CA when printed in the table
of the ""check expiration"" command. ""CAName"" is the field used for that.

In practice kubeconfig files can contain multiple credentials
from different CAs, but this is not supported by kubeadm and there
is a single cluster CA that signs the single client cert/key
in kubeadm managed kubeconfigs.
```

#### What type of PR is this?
/kind feature

#### What this PR does / why we need it:
This PR updates the RootlessControlPlane feature-gate  to be enabled by default. The control-plane components will now run as non-root by default.

#### Which issue(s) this PR fixes:
<!--
*Automatically closes linked issue when PR is merged.

Fixes #

#### Special notes for your reviewer:
I turned the feature gate off in the tests because, in kubernetes unit tests can't run as root and so we cannot update file permissions and create users and groups as needed.

This was manually tested the following way:
1. Created a new kind-node image from these changes.
    ```
    kind build node-image
    ```
2. Created a kind cluster using the new node image.
    ```
    kind create cluster --image kindest/node:latest                                                  
    Creating cluster ""kind"" ...
      ✓ Ensuring node image (kindest/node:latest) 🖼 
      ✓ Preparing nodes 📦  
      ✓ Writing configuration 📜 
      ✓ Starting control-plane 🕹️ 
      ✓ Installing CNI 🔌 
      ✓ Installing StorageClass 💾 
    Set kubectl context to ""kind-kind""
    You can now use your cluster with:

    kubectl cluster-info --context kind-kind

    Thanks for using kind! 😊
    ```
3. Execed into the cluster to make sure that processes are running as non-root users.
    ```
    docker exec -it kind-control-plane /bin/bash
    root@kind-control-plane:/# ps -ax -o uname:16,uid,group:16,gid,supgrp,supgid,cmd

In summary, this mitigates reading from a file while it is still being written to. The mitigation here is to actually do a debounce instead of what looked like a throttle, but was called a debounce (maybe I'm misreading the code or don't know my definitions though :P).

- Ability to return partial result sets.  This is done in a backwards compatible fashion, where a server can either return a `string[]` or an JSON object like:

  ```typescript
  interface VariableItemsList {
    items: string[];
    isIncomplete?: boolean;
    preselect?: string;
  }
  ```

  Where if `isIncomplete` is `true`, it indicates that not all the results have been returned and subsequent queries to the `""url""` field can be sent by the client to narrow down the result set.

- Ability to preselect particular selections, by setting the `""preselect""` value in the variable list response. This allow a registry, for example, to tell the client to choose `mod.ts` as the default selection when completing an import (or whatever the server determines is the appropriate preselection.
- Ability to provide additional documentation for a suggestion/completion item by providing a `""documentation""` endpoint as part of the `deno-import-intellisense.json`. When the client displays a particular item, it will request the server to resolve the completion item, and if the `""documentation""` endpoint is set, a request will be made to that completion endpoint.  The endpoint should response with a documentation object:

  ```ts
   interface Documentation {
    kind: ""markdown"" | ""plaintext"";
    value: string;
  }
  ```

Technically, all these changes are non-breaking with v1, and the language server will simply adjust based on the runtime behaviour of the registry.  The only real change is that v2 will cause the language server to validate the `deno-import-intellisense.json` in against the v2 specification.",4

2135,denoland/deno,kitsonk,feat(lsp): registry suggestion cache respects cache headers,"Fixes #9931

Effectively this adds a ""cache strategy"" to the file fetcher to respect the headers of the cached response, and the LSP registry cache is the only instance of file fetcher that uses this strategy. It isn't a 100% compliant, in the sense that we a) cache in memory per session, irrespective of headers and b) we will always persist a response to the cache, even if the headers tell us not to.  Now though for the registry cache, when we go to access that cache, we will respect any headers we received and only use the cached value if it was valid. We will still only do it once per ""session"" though.

I have tested it locally and it works, but wanted to get any feedback on it before I flesh out all the unit tests, specially from @lucacasonato as you probably have the strongest opinions.",6

2156,denoland/deno,nayeemrmn,refactor(cli): Use GraphData for check and emit,"Fixes #12803.
Fixes #12805.

- fix: Module graph errors show referrer info in all cases.
- fix: Module graph errors for type declaration files (`/// <reference types=""..."" />`, `X-TypeScript-Types`) are properly reported. They can be suppressed with `--no-check`.
- fix: Module graph errors for config file imports (`""jsxImportSources""`) are properly reported.
- TS emits are no longer stored in `ProcState::graph_data` memory. They are requested only once-per-module-per-runtime by V8, which also stores them, so they aren't useful to keep around.
- TS sources are now stored in `ProcState::graph_data` memory. These are a lot more useful to have in many short-circuiting cases.
- In `ProcState::prepare_module_load`, `createGraph()` is given a proxy loader which gives `None` for any module which is already in `ProcState::graph_data` and returns a partal graph. That means their resources aren't reloaded and their dependency branches aren't revisited when building the graph. This case had been hit for any non-statically-analyzable dynamic imports which import any existing dependencies. Performance should be drastically improved for HMR cases and other applications.
- `emit::check_and_maybe_emit()` and `tsc::exec()` are changed to take `GraphData` instead, since they may be have been given a partial graph.
- `GraphData` (now in `cli/graph_util.rs`) is extended a lot to fulfill these new roles. It reimplementes a lot of logic from `deno_graph` to work with composite graphs, hence the LOC diff.

Although not easy to replicate in the wild, the `deno test` op sanitizer
can fail when there are intervals that started before a test runs, since
the op sanitizer can end up running in the time between the timer op for
an interval's run resolves and the op for the next run starts.

This change fixes that by adding a new macrotask callback that will run
after the timer macrotask queue has drained. This ensures that there is
a timer op if there are any timers which are unresolved by the time the
op sanitizer runs.

2179,denoland/deno,andreubotella,fix(test): Improve reliability of `deno test`'s op sanitizer with timers,"Although not easy to replicate in the wild, the `deno test` op sanitizer can fail when there are intervals that started before a test runs, since the op sanitizer can end up running in the time between the timer op for an interval's run resolves and the op for the next run starts.

This change fixes that by adding a new macrotask callback that will run after the timer macrotask queue has drained. This ensures that there is a timer op if there are any timers which are unresolved by the time the op sanitizer runs.

2190,denoland/deno,bartlomieju,"feat(core): Add ability to ""ref"" and ""unref"" pending ops","This commit adds an ability to ""ref"" or ""unref"" pending ops.

Up to this point Deno had a notion of ""async ops"" and ""unref async ops"";
the former keep event loop alive, while the latter do not block event loop
from finishing. It was not possible to change between op types after 
dispatching, one had to decide which type to use before dispatch.

Instead of storing ops in two separate ""FuturesUnordered"" collections,
now ops are stored in a single collection, with supplemental ""HashSet""
storing ids of promises that were ""unrefed"".

Two APIs were added to ""Deno.core"":
- ""Deno.core.refOp(promiseId)"" which allows to mark promise id 
to be ""refed"" and keep event loop alive (the default behavior)
- ""Deno.core.unrefOp(promiseId)"" which allows to mark promise 
id as ""unrefed"" which won't block event loop from exiting

Closes LINK

TODO:
- [x] metrics for unrefed ops (I think that unrefing ops should decrement `ops_dispatched_async` and increment `ops_dispatched_async_unref`, though it seems overly complicated)
- [x] cleanup handling of finished ops (remove `AsyncOpIterator`?)
- [x] add `id` field to promises returned from `Deno.core.opcallAsync`
- [x] add `Deno.core.ref(...promiseIds)` and `Deno.core.unref(...promiseIds)`",18

2208,angular/angular,dylhunn,test(forms): Add more tests for `FormBuilder` method argument shapes.,"Add more tests for `FormBuilder` method argument shapes, especially `array`.

It is possible to pass arguments to `FormBuilder` using many different formats. (`control` can take controls, values, boxed values, and control configs; `array` can take all of these plus nested arrays.) Currently, these different methods are not well-tested, especially as they interact, and especially for the `array` method. This PR will add tests for the variety of different argument shapes.

This was originally inspired by typed forms: when `FormBuilder` becomes typed, all these argument shapes should just work, with correct inferred types.

2212,angular/angular,JoostK,test(ngcc): don't use the workspace typescript version to generate in…,"…tegration test fixtures

Now that ViewEngine libraries can no longer be created, the latest
TypeScript version that ngcc should be able to process is TypeScript 4.3,
i.e. the version of TypeScript that was supported in Angular 12.
However, ngcc's integration tests used the TypeScript version of the
workspace to create the JavaScript files from TypeScript sources on
demand. This introduces friction when upgrading the TypeScript version
within the workspace, as changes to TypeScript's emit format may affect
ngcc's ability to process it correctly.

The on demand creation of JavaScript files was convenient for authoring
tests, but it also helped to detect incompatibilities with newer
versions of TypeScript. Now that ngcc no longer has to process newer
versions of TypeScript, we want to pin the integration suite to use
JavaScript code as if it were compiled using TypeScript 4.3, i.e. a
version of TypeScript that is actually supported by ngcc.

This commit updates the integration test to inline all the generated
files directly in the tests, instead of compiling them on demand. This
was done by temporarily installing TypeScript 4.3 and using it to create
the `loadTestFiles` statement from the original TypeScript inputs.

An alternative could have been to install TypeScript 4.3 as an actual
dependency in the workspace and using that to continue compiling the
integration suite on demand, but this brings some overhead in package
installations (TypeScript is ~60MB) and the authoring aspect of ngcc
integration test is expected to diminish, now that ngcc's support is no
longer a moving target.",1
2213,angular/angular,JoostK,fix(compiler-cli): enable narrowing of using type guard methods,"The changes in 2028c3933f7fe2961999da475febde5a03bb694d caused method
calls to be emitted using additional parenthesis into the TCB, which in
turn prevented proper type narrowing when the method acts as a type
guard. This commit special-cases method calls from property reads to
avoid the additional parenthesis.

2214,angular/angular,dario-piotrowicz,fix(animations): add preventDefault to leaving form elements,"form elements leaving the dom can still trigger submit events

marked as removed

### [`v13.1.0`](LINK

#### Deprecations

#####

-   The `downgradeModule` function calls with NgModule factories are deprecated. Please use NgModule class based `downgradeModule` calls instead.

##### common

-   `TestRequest` from `@angular/common/http/testing` no longer
    accepts `ErrorEvent` when simulating XHR errors. Instead instances of
    `ProgressEvent` should be passed, matching with the native browser behavior.

2219,angular/angular,dylhunn,feat(forms): Allow a FormControl to use initial value as default.,"Allow a FormControl to be reset to its initial value. Provide this feature via a new option in a FormControlOptions interface, based on AbstractControlOptions.

Also, expose the default value as part of the public API. This is part of a feature that has been requested elsewhere (e.g. in #19747).

This was originally proposed as part of typed forms. As discussed in the GDE session (and after with akushnir/alxhub), it is likely better to just reuse the initial value rather than accepting an additional default.

It is desirable to land this separately in order to reduce the scope of the typed forms PR, and make it a types-only change.

Pertains to issue #13721.

- [X] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)

## PR Type
What kind of change does this PR introduce?

- [X] Refactor

Issue Number: #42966

## What is the new behavior?

Implements configuration support for extended template diagnostics. The engine now reads from compiler options to choose what diagnostics are enabled and what their categories are. This is still protected by the experimental `_extendedTemplateDiagnostics` option so we can merge it to patch. A follow-up PR will enable this specifically for the next minor release.

The configuration looks like:

```jsonc
{
  ""angularCompilerOptions"": {
    ""extendedDiagnostics"": {
      // The categories to use for specific diagnostics.
      ""checks"": {
        // Maps check name to its category.
        ""invalidBananaInBox"": ""suppress""
      },

      // The category to use for any diagnostics not listed in `checks` above.
      ""defaultCategory"": ""error""
    }
  }
}
```

Allowed categories for a diagnostic are `warning` (default), `error`, or `suppress`. `error` will fail the compilation if the diagnostic is emitted, while `suppress` will ignore the diagnostic altogether. As an optimization, ignored diagnostics are not executed at all to avoid wasting CPU resources.

The configuration is validated and will throw errors with specific codes for simple mistakes, such as a typo in a check name or the diagnostic category. Extended template diagnostics also require that `strictTemplates` is enabled, since they require much of the same type information and would be fairly useless without that knowledge.

The implementation required some refactorings, adding a new `ExtendedTmplateDiagnosticName` enum to act as a centralized list of all possible diagnostic names which can be used in the configuration. It also introduced a `TemplateCheckFactory` concept which binds the error code and diagnostic name together in a way that is usable *before* constructing the template check. This allows us to skip suppressed checks by not even constructing them.

Previously, when processing UMD, ngcc assumed that the `exports` argument of the CommonJS factory call (if present) would be the first argument of the call. This is generally true for the supported UMD formats, but can change if ngcc prepends more imports (and thus factory arguments) while processing the module. This could lead to errors when trying to collect dependencies of an already processed module.
(This was accidentally broken in #44245 (commit 2bc3522e167).)

2238,angular/angular,crisbeto,refactor(animations): remove unnecessary code,"* The `TransitionAnimationEngine` had a fallback where it would store classes directly on a node if it doesn't have a `classList`.

These changes simplify the logic to just a null check.
* Deprecates the `AnimationDriver.matchesElement` method, because it was only used in one place which can be replaced with `classList.contains`. We can't remove the method completely, because `AnimationDriver` is a public API.

2242,angular/angular,dgp1130,build: enable `noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature`,"This flag makes TypeScript throw an error when using `foo.bar` syntax to resolve an index signature type (`{[prop: string]: T}`). This avoids accidentally using the index signature type when a more explict type was intended, catching many typos. For example, it would catch:

```typescript
interface Foo {
  bar: string;
  [prop: string]: any;
}

const foo: Foo = /* ... */;
foo.bar; // string
foo.abr; // Error...
foo['abr']; // any
```

Motivation for this is an upcoming `CompilerOptions` change for extended template diagnostics which will require adding `{[prop: string]: any}` to remain compatible with TypeScript's existing types while having a more flexible `tsconfig.json` structure.

It's only really needed in the `compiler-cli` package, but I put this in `packages/tsconfig.json` to be consistent across the whole repository. If that's too broad, I can narrow it down to `packages/compiler-cli/tsconfig.json`.

-   Changed `jsdom.nodeLocation()` to return `undefined` when used on nodes that originate via fragment parsing (e.g., via `innerHTML`). Previously it would return based on the node location of the fragment string, which made node locations unreliable with respect to the original document source. This restores the behavior that was present in v14.0.0, and was accidentally broken in v14.1.0. (bakkot)
-   Fixed calling `window.close()` inside the `Window`'s `load` event to no longer crash. (MattiasBuelens)

## What is the current behavior?
It's currently possible to use any string as the HTTP method.
As discussed with Pete and @AndrewKushnir it could be interesting to have a more strictly typed API,
and only allow valid HTTP methods (both in lowercase and uppercase to preserve the existing behavior)

## What is the new behavior?

This commit tightens the API to only accept one of the possible HTTP verb, either in lowercase or in uppercase (to preserve the existing behavior).

## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?

- [x] Yes
- [ ] No

The HTTP method must now be one of `'GET'|'HEAD'|'POST'|'PUT'|'DELETE'|'CONNECT'|'OPTIONS'|'TRACE'|'PATCH'|'JSONP'` (or one of these in lowercase) instead of a `string`. This helps developers to catch possible typos like `http.request('POTS', ...)`, but can result in compilation errors when updating if you have such typos in your code. In the rare cases where developers used a temporary string variable to store the method, the type of this variable must be updated to be a string literal, for example `const method = 'GET' as const`.

To get the same information with this and upcoming releases, use v1 tunnels REST API endpoint `/tunnels?all=true&full=true` to get all the tunnels for the user and their org. The endpoint is a part of the supported API version.

2265,angular/angular,dylhunn,refactor(forms): Move FormControl to an overridden constructor.,"This implementation change was originally proposed as part of Typed Forms, and will have major consequences for that project as described in the design doc. In summary, this change causes the constructor for `FormControl` to be decoupled from its implementation. This will allow us to provide multiple constructor signatures in the future, and even to return `FormControl<T>` where `T` takes different values depending on the constructor signature selected. (For example, in the simple case, `new FormControl<string>('foo')` will return `FormControl<string|null>`.)

Accordingly, a new exported symbol is created to provide various constructor overrides, with documentation examples for how to use the different constructors. (Currently there are only two, but there will be more after Typed Forms/default values.)

Submitting this change separately is desirable for a few reasons:
- It reduces the risk of landing Typed Forms -- the constructor override is complicated, and is fundamentally separate from the core types.
- It enables us to submit a follow-up change for default values before Typed Forms lands, thus separating the only runtime behavior change from all the types-only changes.

This change should have no visible impact on users of `FormControl`.

See the Typed Forms design doc here: LINK

2266,angular/angular,JoostK,perf(common): code size reduction of `ngFor` directive,"This commit makes several changes to the implementation of `NgForOf` to
reduce its code size in production builds:

1. The tailor-made message for an unsupported differ is fully
   tree-shaken in production builds, in favor of the exception from the
   differ factory itself.
2. The private `_perViewChange` method was changed into a free-standing
   function, to allow its name to be minimized.
3. The need for an intermediate `RecordViewTuple` was avoided by
   applying the operation in-place, instead of collection all insertions
   into a buffer first. This is safe as the `_perViewChange` operation
   that used to be done on each `RecordViewTuple` is entirely local to
   the tuple itself. Hence, it is invariant to execution ordering which
   means that the `_perViewChange` can be executed directly during the

@gkalpak sorry it took me a while to get around to this one :sweat: 
 
By a search I've found 2 cases in which the autolinking was wrong and 2 in which it was actually correct:

![Screenshot at 2021-11-27 22-39-53](LINK

So adding it to the ignoredwords may not look too necessary, if you prefer I can instead break the unwanted autolinkings instead (but I think it would actually be a good addition there as a bit generic) :slightly_smiling_face: ",1

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [chalk](LINK | [`^4.1.0` -> `^5.0.0`](LINK | [![age](LINK | [![adoption](LINK | [![passing](LINK | [![confidence](LINK |

---

### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>chalk/chalk (chalk)</summary>

### [`v5.0.0`](LINK

[Compare Source](LINK

##### Breaking

-   **This package is now pure ESM. Please [read this](LINK
    -   If you use TypeScript, you will want to stay on Chalk 4 until TypeScript 4.6 is out. [Why.](LINK
    -   If you use a bundler, make sure it supports ESM and that you have correctly configured it for ESM.
    -   The Chalk issue tracker is not a support channel for your favorite build/bundler tool.
-   Require Node.js 12.20  [`fa16f4e`](LINK
-   Move some properties off the default export to individual named exports:
    -   `chalk.Instance` → `Chalk`
    -   `chalk.supportsColor` → `supportsColor`
    -   `chalk.stderr` → `chalkStderr`
    -   `chalk.stderr.supportsColor` → `supportsColorStderr`
-   Remove `.keyword()`, `.hsl()`, `.hsv()`, `.hwb()`, and `.ansi()` coloring methods ([#&#8203;433](LINK  [`4cf2e40`](LINK
    -   These were not commonly used and added a lot of bloat to Chalk. You can achieve the same by using the [`color-convert` package](LINK
-   The tagged template literal support moved into a separate package: [`chalk-template`](LINK ([#&#8203;524](LINK  [`c987c61`](LINK

```diff
-import chalk from 'chalk';
+import chalkTemplate from 'chalk-template';

-chalk`2 + 3 = {bold ${2 + 3}}`;
+chalkTemplate`2 + 3 = {bold ${2 + 3}}`;
```

##### Improvements

-   Bundle dependencies  [`04fdbd6`](LINK
    -   This means Chalk no longer has any dependencies 🎉
-   [The install size is less than half of v4.](LINK
-   Add `overline` style  ([#&#8203;433](LINK  [`4cf2e40`](LINK
-   Preserve function prototype methods ([#&#8203;434](LINK  [`0fba91b`](LINK

2291,angular/angular,atscott,fix(language-service): Correctly parse inputs and selectors with dollar signs,"When we are going to the definition of an input, we find _both_ the
definition of the input _and_ also look for any directives which have
a selector that matches the input. For example:

```
@Directive({
  selector: '[greeting]'
})
export class MyDir {
  @Input() greeting!: string;
}
```

With this commit, we now correctly handle the case where inputs and/or
selectors have a dollar sign in them. The dollar sign has special
meaning in CSS, but when we encounter the dollar in a template, we need
to escape it when used as a selector so that it is taken as a dollar
literal rather than a character with special meaning.

Previously, we were not escaping the dollar sign and the CSS parsing
logic would throw an error. The change in this commit prevents that
error from happening, but a `try...catch` is still added in case there
is another unhandled use-case. If this happens, we do not want the
`goToDefinition` operation to completely fail.

2292,angular/angular,JoostK,refactor(platform-browser-dynamic): remove private export of `Resourc…,"…eLoaderImpl`

This type was exported for the ViewEngine compiler as it needed to
reference the class in its DI codegen. This is no longer a requirement
with Ivy, hence the private export can be removed.

This change prevents an import of `@angular/compiler` to be referenced
in the .d.ts file of `@angular/platform-browser-dynamic`, which is
beneficial for application compilations as that prevents the
`@angular/compiler` .d.ts files from being included in the `ts.Program`
of an application.

Rebasing might not happen immediately, so don't worry if this takes some time.

Note: if you make any changes to this PR yourself, they will take precedence over the rebase.

<details>
<summary>Release notes</summary>
<p><em>Sourced from <a href=""LINK releases</a>.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Version 19.0.0</h2>
<ul>
<li>Changed <code>jsdom.nodeLocation()</code> to return <code>undefined</code> when used on nodes that originate via fragment parsing (e.g., via <code>innerHTML</code>). Previously it would return based on the node location of the fragment string, which made node locations unreliable with respect to the original document source. This restores the behavior that was present in v14.0.0, and was accidentally broken in v14.1.0. (bakkot)</li>
<li>Fixed calling <code>window.close()</code> inside the <code>Window</code>'s <code>load</code> event to no longer crash. (MattiasBuelens)</li>

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [chalk](LINK | [`^4.0.0` -> `^5.0.0`](LINK | [![age](LINK | [![adoption](LINK | [![passing](LINK | [![confidence](LINK |

### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>chalk/chalk</summary>

### [`v5.0.0`](LINK

[Compare Source](LINK

##### Breaking

-   **This package is now pure ESM. Please [read this](LINK
    -   If you use TypeScript, you will want to stay on Chalk 4 until TypeScript 4.6 is out. [Why.](LINK
    -   If you use a bundler, make sure it supports ESM and that you have correctly configured it for ESM.
    -   The Chalk issue tracker is not a support channel for your favorite build/bundler tool.
-   Require Node.js 12.20  [`fa16f4e`](LINK
-   Move some properties off the default export to individual named exports:
    -   `chalk.Instance` → `Chalk`
    -   `chalk.supportsColor` → `supportsColor`
    -   `chalk.stderr` → `chalkStderr`
    -   `chalk.stderr.supportsColor` → `supportsColorStderr`
-   Remove `.keyword()`, `.hsl()`, `.hsv()`, `.hwb()`, and `.ansi()` coloring methods ([#&#8203;433](LINK  [`4cf2e40`](LINK
    -   These were not commonly used and added a lot of bloat to Chalk. You can achieve the same by using the [`color-convert` package](LINK
-   The tagged template literal support moved into a separate package: [`chalk-template`](LINK ([#&#8203;524](LINK  [`c987c61`](LINK

```diff
-import chalk from 'chalk';
+import chalkTemplate from 'chalk-template';

-chalk`2 + 3 = {bold ${2 + 3}}`;
+chalkTemplate`2 + 3 = {bold ${2 + 3}}`;
```

##### Improvements

-   Bundle dependencies  [`04fdbd6`](LINK
    -   This means Chalk no longer has any dependencies 🎉
-   [The install size is less than half of v4.](LINK
-   Add `overline` style  ([#&#8203;433](LINK  [`4cf2e40`](LINK
-   Preserve function prototype methods ([#&#8203;434](LINK  [`0fba91b`](LINK

### 💡 Background and solution
I've noticed that there aren't polish translations for form validation. When adding this I figured I'll go ahead and add all missing translations (basing them on `default.tsx`).

I haven't seen a place in code where I could see all translations (I've tested this using various components and wrapping them in docs with ConfigProvider). Is there one place where we can see all translations?

- With errors that contain multiple code spans, the message for subsequent locations is moved above the code itself, which means that some error messages might need to be subtly changed.

Fixes #46824 

## Description

Base on the suggestions in #46824, these two errors should not be reported if the private identifier is used inside a `for...in`

> ""error TS2304: Cannot find name '#fiel'.""

> ""error TS1451: Private identifiers are only allowed in class bodies and may only be used as part of a class member declaration, property access, or on the left-hand-side of an 'in' expression""

For TS2304, an additional check is it also should not be reported if the private identifier is used with `in` operator.

In the issue, @sandersn suggests 

> Cannot find name '#fiel'.

should only check for `in` operator and `getSymbolForPrivateIdentifierExpression`. But if I don't check for the `for...in` as well, it will show like this
```bash
for (#field in v) { /**/ } // Bad - 'in' not allowed

error TS2304: Cannot find name '#field'.
error TS2406: The left-hand side of a 'for...in' statement must be a variable or a property access.
```

2408,microsoft/TypeScript,ahejlsberg,Fix multiple issues with indexed access types applied to mapped types,"This PR fixes multiple issues related to indexed access types applied to mapped types. The fixes enable most of the problems outlined in #30581 to be solved using an approach that involves ""distributive object types"" created using indexed access types applied to mapped types.

First, a summary of the issue we're trying to solve:

```ts
type UnionRecord = 
    | { kind: ""n"", v: number, f: (v: number) => void }
    | { kind: ""s"", v: string, f: (v: string) => void }
    | { kind: ""b"", v: boolean, f: (v: boolean) => void };

function processRecord(rec: UnionRecord) {
    rec.f(rec.v);  // Error, 'string | number | boolean' not assignable to 'never'
}
```

The `UnionRecord` type is a union of records with two correlated properties, `v` and `f`, where the type of `v` is always the same as the type of `f`'s parameter. In the `processRecord` function we're attempting to take advantage of the correlation by calling `rec.f(rec.v)` for some record. By casual inspection this seems perfectly safe, but the type checker doesn't see it that way. From its viewpoint, the type of `rec.v` is `string | number | boolean` and the type of `rec.f` is `(v: never) => void`, the `never` originating from the intersection `string & number & boolean`. The type is basically trying to check if a `v` from _some_ record can be passed as an argument to an `f` from _some_ record--but not necessarily the _same_ record.

In the following I will outline an approach to writing types for this kind of pattern. Key to the approach is that the union types in question contain a discriminant property with a type that can itself serve as a property name (e.g. a string literal type or a unique symbol type). Note that the examples below only compile successfully with the fixes in this PR.

The following formulation of the `UnionRecord` type encodes the correspondence between kinds and types and the correlated properties:

```ts
type RecordMap = { n: number, s: string, b: boolean };
type RecordType<K extends keyof RecordMap> = { kind: K, v: RecordMap[K], f: (v: RecordMap[K]) => void };
type UnionRecord = RecordType<'n'> | RecordType<'s'> | RecordType<'b'>;
```

The manual step of creating a union of `RecordType<K>` for each key in `RecordMap` can instead be automated:

```ts
type UnionRecord = { [P in keyof RecordMap]: RecordType<P> }[keyof RecordMap];
```

The pattern of applying an indexed access type to a mapped type is effectively a device for distributing a type (in this case `RecordType<P>`) over a union (in this case `keyof RecordMap`). We can even go one step further and allow a `UnionRecord` to be created for any arbitrary subset of keys:

```ts
type UnionRecord<K extends keyof RecordMap = keyof RecordMap> = { [P in K]: RecordType<P> }[K];
```

We can then merge `RecordType<K>` into `UnionRecord<K>`, which removes the possibility of creating non-distributed records. This leaves us with the final formulation:

```ts
type RecordMap = { n: number, s: string, b: boolean };
type UnionRecord<K extends keyof RecordMap = keyof RecordMap> = { [P in K]: {
    kind: P,
    v: RecordMap[P],
    f: (v: RecordMap[P]) => void
}}[K];
```

And, using this formulation, we can now write types for the `processRecord` function that reflect the correlation and work for singletons as well as unions:

```ts
function processRecord<K extends keyof RecordMap>(rec: UnionRecord<K>) {
    rec.f(rec.v);  // Ok
}

declare const r1: UnionRecord<'n'>;  // { kind: 'n', v: number, f: (v: number) => void }
declare const r2: UnionRecord;  // { kind: 'n', ... } | { kind: 's', ... } | { kind: 'b', ... }

processRecord(r1);
processRecord(r2);
processRecord({ kind: 'n', v: 42, f: v => v.toExponential() });
```

And, because everything is expressed in terms of the mapping in `RecordMap`, new kinds and data types can be added in a single place, nicely conforming to the DRY principle.

Significantly changes the package.json auto-import provider’s resolution process. Previously it used `resolveTypeReferenceDirective` with a fallback to `tryResolveJsModule` for JS projects. Using `resolveTypeReferenceDirective` was close but not quite right, so this fixes a couple straight up bugs, and also gives us the opportunity to pull in all files specifically referenced by an export map so those can be offered as auto-imports too. (Files matching a pattern export aren’t pulled in.)

2420,microsoft/TypeScript,jakebailey,Explicitly Omit unspreadable properties from rest type in the generic case,"Fixes #46967

In the non-generic case, we'd produce a concrete type that consisted only of the spreadable properties, excluding already destructured and unspreadable properties. This is good.

However, in the generic case (including `this`, as it's an implicit type parameter), we instead produced an `Omit` type, but only omitted the already destructured keys. This left a type where all of the unspreadable properties (e.g. properties with getters, methods) where left accessible.

Make the generic case match the behavior of the non-generic case by also adding the unspreadable items to the omitted set of keys.

This might get pretty hairy for types with lots of getters/setters/methods, though, but the alternative (making a concrete type instead if it looks like `Omit` can't handle it) appears to break a few tests in even more undesirable ways. Hopefully destructuring `this` with a rest is not all that common (the user tests imply it is not).

Additionally, I don't know if the behavior on non-public properties is correct; it seems weird that destructuring `this` within the class would only keep the public properties, even though at runtime they are there. They're dropped in the `T extends SomeClass` case because that's a use where those symbols are not intended to be visible, but internally, maybe it's not right to drop them.

2430,microsoft/TypeScript,weswigham,Allow nongeneric string mapping types to exist,"In the same way that `` `${number}` `` represents the set of all number strings, this lets `Uppercase<string>` represent the set of all strings unaffected by uppercasing (implying they're already uppercase), and the same for `Lowercase`, `Capitalize`, and `Uncapitalize`. As part of this, all of these string mapping types also are actually applied to template literal types, rather than... not. So ``Lowercase<`A${string}`>`` is now `` `a${Lowercase<string>}` ``, rather than the very clearly wrong `` `A${string}` ``. `Capitalize` and `Uncapitalize` only affect the first segment of a pattern template literal, reflecting their implementation, so ``Capitalize<`a${string}`>`` is just `` `A${string}` ``, while ``Capitalize<`${string}-${string}`>`` is `` `${Capitalize<string>}-${string}` ``.

I'd argue that this means that the entire chain of items in a comma expression (of any size) should have this applied, since they are being thought of here as a list of statements with potential side effects, and not just the leftmost expression.",5

2446,microsoft/TypeScript,RyanCavanaugh,Bail on 0- and 1-length lists in `removeSubtypes` to avoid spurious circularity problems,"Creates a reasonable workaround for #46939

Another example for illustration:
```ts
type Box = {
  content?: Foo
};
declare const b: Box;
class Foo {
  get foo() {
    return {
      content: this as Foo,
      ...b
    };
  }
}
```
When resolving the type of `Foo#foo`, we need to compute the type of the object literal in the return position. This has two parts: the `content` from the `content: ` property (type `Foo`), and the `content` property from type `Box` (which is `Foo | missing`).

We want the type of `content` here to be subtype-reduced when creating the union of the two possible constituents, `Foo` and `Foo`. That list gets deduped in `getUnionType` to just `[Foo]`, *then passed to `removeSubTypes`*, which computes this value ahead of the `while` loop below it which in reality runs zero iterations:
```ts
            const hasEmptyObject = hasObjectTypes && some(types, t => !!(t.flags & TypeFlags.Object) && !isGenericMappedType(t) && isEmptyResolvedType(resolveStructuredTypeMembers(t as ObjectType)));
```
That call to `resolveStructuredTypeMembers` attempts to resolve the type of `Foo#foo`, triggering a circularity even though none actually exists.

Instead we can just bail out earlier in the function, saving time (I hope?) and avoiding this computation until later when doing so won't introduce a circularity.",4

I thought I filed a bug for this in the past, but I can't find it. Formatting works by advancing the scanner token by token and deciding if any rules apply for a pair of consecutive tokens. When you format a specific range, we used to stop the scanner as soon as it advanced outside that range.

An AutoImportProviderProject contains only files that the host Project does not. However, it’s possible, as in the test written here, that the main project only knows about a file via its realpath, but it also exists as a symlink inside `node_modules`. Because that symlink was mentioned in the package.json dependencies, we discover it as part of spinning up an AutoImportProviderProject. However, when we see that the SourceFile we resolved to is already contained by the host Project, we skip it entirely, discarding the knowledge of the symlink we found. This PR allows the AutoImportProviderProject to add that symlink knowledge to the host project’s cache before it decides not to add the file to itself. This way, the host Project is still responsible for generating auto-imports of that SourceFile, but it can come up with the correct module specifier for it using the symlink information discovered by the AutoImportProviderProject.",1

When updating a SourceFile, the incremental parser copies the old SourceFile’s `impliedNodeFormat` to the new one. Reusing module resolution from the old Program later expects that field to already be set on the updated SourceFile. However, the incremental parser is skipped when the language service gets overwhelmed by changes—specifically, when there are 8 or more changes logged against the snapshot before the language service asks for an updated SourceFile, or when the length of a text change is greater than 256 characters. In these cases, the SourceFile is re-parsed from scratch, and so it lacks its `impliedNodeFormat` field.

These errors mirror runtime checks done by Javascript. The checker has many more errors that also cover runtime checks. I'll start on those next.

There are a few errors in the binder that don't have matching runtime errors: they *nearly* always indicate incorrect code, but not always. 

### A label is not allowed here

I decided to include ""A label is not allowed here"" because, even though it's not a runtime error on its own, if you use the label it will not be defined, which *is* a runtime error, and because the compiler error for the undefined label is so bad.

### An object literal cannot have multiple properties with the same name in strict mode

I decided not to include this error, since it's not a runtime error in ES2015 and above according to an SO answer I found. It's a useful error for TS, though; probably the error message should be changed to read ""An object literal **should** not have multiple properties with the same name."", or else it should be restricted to ES5-only. I filed LINK to track that.

The issue wasn't that the mapped types were losing information, per sey, in fact, they were responsible for rehydrating missing information in some instances - instead, the issue was that we were too eagerly reducing the `keyof` result of unions over types which might have been reduced upon instantiation, like `({v: T} & {v: ""a"", a: string}) | ({v: T} & {v: ""b"", b: string})`. Before this change, `keyof` that was just `""v""`, while now it will remain the generic `keyof (({v: T} & {v: ""a"", a: string}) | ({v: T} & {v: ""b"", b: string}))`, since instantiation can make it simplify to either `keyof ({v: ""a""} & {v: ""a"", a: string})` or `keyof ({v: ""b""} & {v: ""b"", b: string})`, which have keys `""v"" | ""a""` or `""v"" | ""b""`, respectively.  (Which in turn trickles down to assignability behavior of mapped types over those kinds of `keyof` types)

2. the quick info of getter/setter in the class shows ""(getter/setter)"" rather than ""property"", but for property access of getter/setter, it still shows ""property"".
3. getter/setter inherits correspond getter/setter if none of getter/setter is overridden, or nothing if one of getter/setter is overridden. And for property access of getter/setter, it inherit its getter and setter JsDoc tags
4. add JsDocTags parameter to fourslash `quickInfoAt` and `quickInfoIs`. Note that if this parameter is not given, the check is skipped now. Maybe we should create one issue to always compare JsDocTags?

Scaling a `THREE.Color` by linear intensity is more complicated once we accept sRGB inputs. One prominent example was RoomEnvironment. This PR changes RoomEnvironment to use emissive and emissiveIntensity instead of `color.setScalar( intensity )`, and adds a uniform to ensure that emissive and emissiveIntensity are not pre-multiplied.

If we don't want to ever consider Color values to be sRGB, then this change is not necessary.

This PR can be safely merged with or without the addition of a linear workflow, and is more consistent with how we handle `specularColor` and `specularIntensity` already.

I noticed a difference between our implementation and OpenEXR's in trying to decompress a block only if input-data is actually smaller than the expected data-size. This PR standardizes this issue and makes equivalent to OpenEXR implementation.

It also initially includes support for luminance - single channel files `HalfFloatType / FloatType`. 
Luminance images are treated as `RedFormat` - WebGL2 only context.

Updated  `textureData` header info to include specification flags, to help identify if problematic files contain lack of supported features like  Deep-Image, Multi-Part or Tiled image files.

![image](LINK

I largely tested these changes, but would appreciate further testing - @Mugen87, @WestLangley 

-- 

Currently we fail to support `.setDataType( THREE.UnsignedByteType )` on Luminance maps. 

`setDataType` is properly followed even in cases where there is an underlying mismatch between input-type and output-types.  
( e.g like a float32b input file transformed into a half16b texture ). When we set the output-type to `UnsignedByteType` on a RGB/RGBA files we also encode the output-texture as `RGBEEncoding` and transform the data appropriately.

However transforming a luminance map of 32/16 type to an uint8 type is not yet specified, should I explicitly allow that transformation? If so, should I then change the texture format to `LuminanceFormat` in order to support WebGL1 contexts?

The only reason I wrote PMREMGenerator to use RGBE internally  was because at the time there was not decent floating point rendering support. This made the code complicated and slow because I had to do manual bilinear interpolation (since decode was needed before mixing). 

Here I've removed all that by switching PMREM to use HalfFloat internally. I suppose it'll take twice the GPU RAM (16 bits vs 8), but hopefully that's more than offset by skipping a bunch of exponentiation. I've tested on my Macbook Pro and my Pixel 3 and can't see any difference to our glTF renders. I'd appreciate some more device testing, but I'm fairly  confident given our widely deployed use of HalfFloat render targets in MV.

BTW: I've added a `TODO` comment to `uploadCubeTexture()` to highlight a subtle issue that should be solved at some point.

2562,mrdoob/three.js,Chrissie-AI,Update LatheGeometry.js,"This proposed change follows a two-step approach:
1. pre-compute normals in 2D-domain (all z = 0) for initial ""meridian"" of vertices as defined in the points[] array

<img width=""623"" alt=""Normals_in_2D_domain"" src=""LINK
Path: blue; Vertices on path: red; axis of lathe: green; Normals: red

2. rotate pre-computed normals along with vertices for each additional meridian in lathing
.
**Advantages:**
* Considerably reduces computational expense of setting up normals.
* perfect normal precision (within limits of numerical accuracy), avoids considerable deviations from precision in low lathe-segment count situations of current approach
* seam-handling obsoleted by design

This is going to be my first pull request.  Please see attached screenshots for clarification of the concept.

Related issue: #XXXX

**Description**

I observed significant mis-alignment of normals computed via computeVertexNormals() from their expected true orientation, especially in low lathe segment counts. Those mis-alignments have considerable impact on the quality and fidelity of computed reflections.

I found the cause for the observed mis-alignments to be a lack of symmetry in the faces surrounding a shared vertex. The lack of symmetry may manifest itself in an unequal number of faces ""pulling"" left vs. right, or up vs. down, or different sizes of neighbouring faces sharing the same vertex. Consider for instance the following 4-segment, full circle lathe of a 2-vertex path:

points.length = 0;
points.push( new THREE.Vector2( 15.0,  0.0 ) ); 
points.push( new THREE.Vector2(  5.0, 10.0 ) ); 

Looking straight down the Y-axis, **seam at bottom meridian**:

<img width=""616"" alt=""pic1"" src=""LINK

Vertex number 8 (counting from 1 to 8), circled green, is a case in point: two adjacent faces on the south-west slope pulling down, only one face on the north-west slope pulling up. Hence we observe a systematic CCW twist of the projected normal @ all inner vertices away from the expected radial orientation - except for the seam, which looks pretty much OK (but still isn't, if you look at the numeric components of the normal @ vertex  number 2.
Likewise, for the same reason, we observe a systematic CW twist of the projected normals @ all outer vertices away from the expected radial orientation - again except for the seam.

My proposed change yields perfect radial alignment of the projected (along the axis of lathing) normals and makes special seam handling obsolete by design.

Please note, that fixing the mis-aligned normals of the current approach may break some E2E test. This is in itself would not be indicative of an error.

2569,mrdoob/three.js,Mugen87,Introduce FramebufferTexture.,"Related issue: -

**Description**

The current usage of `WebGLRenderer.copyFramebufferToTexture()` is incorrect and also incompatible with `gl.texStorage2D()`.

When copying data from the current bound framebuffer to a texture, the texture itself does not need any data definitions. So no call of `gl.texImage2D()` is required. It's sufficient to bind the texture and then call `gl.copyTexImage2D()`.

`gl.copyTexImage2D()` is incompatible with immutable textures so calling `gl.texStorage2D()` is not required and wouldn't work anyway (since `gl.texStorage2D()` defines immutable texture storage).

Since it is not possible right now to properly process a texture in `WebGLTextures` which was updated via `WebGLRenderer.copyFramebufferToTexture()`, a new type of texture (`FramebufferTexture`) is introduced.

- Add an example SVG that is rendered in the correct order after this change

Related issue: #22898

**Description**

SVGLoader generates multiple meshes that need to be rendered in-order. Before this commit, the transparent attribute of the generated materials was set based on the fill or stroke opacity, which separated materials into the opaque and transparent render lists, and gave the incorrect render ordering.

Additionally as all the meshes are in the z=0 plane (SVG is a 2D format), depthWrite is set false for all of the materials. This is another reason to have all SVG meshes in the transparent render list, as it means they will behave correctly with respect to 3D meshes in the scene that do render into the depth buffer.",1
2573,mrdoob/three.js,Mugen87,MeshToonMaterial: Only sample the red channel of gradientMap.,"Related issue: -

**Description**

When we want to use `texStorage2D()` it's important to understand that `gl.LUMINANCE` can not be used as an internal format. The idea is to use `gl.RED` instead which is converted to the sized formats `gl.R8`, `gl.R16F` or `gl.R32F` by the renderer depending on the data type.

When using a texture with e.g. `gl.R8`, only the `r` channel can be sampled. This PR refactors the toon material such that the shader only samples the red channel and not RGB. In this way, the gradient map does not break if we use `THREE.RedFormat` with WebGL 2.

I'm not sure why it was implemented differently since gradient maps for toon materials are usually grayscale maps with a (n,1) dimension.",1

- #12242

Currently normalized attributes do not work correctly with raycasting, and perhaps other logic. There are a few possible way to fix that, narrowly or broadly:

1. Handle denormalization narrowly in `Mesh.raycast`
    - Fixes raycasting and nothing else
2. Handle denormalization narrowly in `VectorX.fromBufferAttribute`
    - Fixes raycasting and perhaps some other cases
    - Means `vector.fromBufferAttribute` is not consistent with `attribute.getX`
3. Handle denormalization/normalization in all `BufferAttribute` getters/setters
    - Fixes any usage that doesn't access `attribute.array` directly. Avoiding direct access to `attribute.array` is already necessary for code that intends to support interleaved attributes, so a similar rule for normalized attributes seems reasonable.

As shown in this PR, (3) does require some more code than the alternatives. Do we have a preference among these?

The second use case I added was how to sign in to an account using Puppeteer. This example also illustrates using Promises to wait for two promises to resolve: (1) clicking a button which will navigate away from the current page, and (2) waiting for the network to be idle.

**Summary**

CDP will sometimes fire multiple `Fetch.requestPaused` events for a single `Network.requestWillBeSent` event. Puppeteer incorrectly assumes a 1:1 relationship between these events which causes request interception to hang because the second `Fetch.requestPaused` event is never `continue()`'d.

No, but it's really hard to test this.

2617,puppeteer/puppeteer,etanol,"fix: prevent potential browser stall when ""dumpio: false""","<!-- Thanks for submitting a pull request! Please provide enough information so that others can review your pull request. -->

**What kind of change does this PR introduce?**

Bugfix (potentially).

<!-- E.g. a bugfix, feature, refactoring, build related change, etc… -->

**Did you add tests for your changes?**

No.

**If relevant, did you update the documentation?**

No.

**Summary**

When calling `puppeteer.launch()` with options `pipe` and `dumpio` set to `false` there's a risk of blocking the browser process, resulting in timeouts during a test execution.

With `pipe` and `dumpio` set to false, the standard error output (_stderr_, fd 2) of the browser _subprocess_ is attached to  a pipe.  However, the pipe is never drained.  If the browser process happens to emit a significant amount of **error** output, the pipe may become full.  As a result, the browser may block indefinitely at the next attempt of writing to _stderr_.

To put it graphically:

![Process blockage diagram](LINK

<!--
@startuml
rectangle NodeJS as node
queue ""Pipe\n(full)"" as pipe
rectangle Browser as browser

node <<~ pipe : ""No\ndraining""
pipe <<=[#red] browser : ""Blocked\nwrite""

node <-[#green,thickness=3]> browser : ""Web\nSocket\n(potentially unresponsive)""
@enduml
-->

This change just aligns the configuration of `dumpio` behavior for _stdin_, _stdout_ and _stderr_ no matter the value of `pipe`.

<!-- Explain the **motivation** for making this change. What existing problem does the pull request solve? -->
<!-- Try to link to an open issue for more information. -->

**Does this PR introduce a breaking change?**

No.

<!-- If this PR introduces a breaking change, please describe the impact and a migration path for existing applications. -->

**Other information**

While browsers are multi-threaded and this issue seems speculative, sometimes more fundamental dependencies may be writing to _stderr_.  For example, the GTK library (the browser GUI toolkit used in Unix systems) can become very chatty under some environment conditions.  A simple write to _stderr_ can block a significant chunk of logic in the browser; for example, one of the event loops.  This is because the standard I/O descriptors are rarely configured or operated in a non-blocking fashion.",1

2627,puppeteer/puppeteer,whimboo,fix: try to remove the temporary user data directory after the proces…,"Seen while investigating issues on Windows via #7668. We are trying to remove the temporary user data directory before the process is killed. That means that the process has still hold on some of the files, and removing the folder will definitely fail.

A try to remove the folder should happen afterward.",3
2628,puppeteer/puppeteer,andyearnshaw,fix(ariaqueryhandler): allow single quotes in aria attribute selector,"This updates the regular expression used to parse aria attribute
selectors so that single quotes may be used as an alternative to double
quotes, e.g. `aria/Single button[role='button']`.

2629,puppeteer/puppeteer,connorjclark,fix: clearer jsdoc for behavior of `headless` when `devtools` is true,"The existing comment suggests that only the default changes–however, even if you set `devtools: false` and `headless: true`, Puppeteer will still open with headful.

2630,puppeteer/puppeteer,timocov,fix: fix exported types,"**What kind of change does this PR introduce?** bugfix

**Did you add tests for your changes?** No

**If relevant, did you update the documentation?** Not relevant

**Summary**

You cannot export functions if actually you export a class (methods of a class != separate functions).

Fixes #7529

**Does this PR introduce a breaking change?**

To use `launch` method (and any other methods from Puppeteer class) now you have to import `puppeteer` via import default export, i.e. `import puppeteer from 'puppeteer'`.

<blockquote>
<h2>v10.3.0</h2>
<p>Questions about this release? Ask in the official discussion thread: <a href=""LINK
<p><strong>Added</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Declare types for node builtin modules within REPL so you do not need to import them (<a href=""LINK <a href=""LINK
<ul>
<li>Node REPL exposes builtin modules as globals; typechecker now understands this</li>
<li>Typechecking should no longer raise errors when using builtins without first importing</li>
<li>For example: <code>util.promisify(setTimeout)(1000)</code> or <code>fs.readFileSync('example.txt')</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Add <code>createEsmHooks()</code> function to create ESM loader hooks (<a href=""LINK docs</a>) (<a href=""LINK <a href=""LINK
<ul>
<li>Can be used to compose our loader hooks with another loader or additional logic</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>register()</code> accepts a ts-node <code>Service</code> (<a href=""LINK docs</a>) (<a href=""LINK
<ul>
<li><code>register(options)</code> is still supported; no breaking changes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Add support for Node.js's new loader hooks API (<a href=""LINK <a href=""LINK <a href=""LINK <a href=""LINK
<ul>
<li>Node.js has changed their loader hooks API</li>
<li>ts-node is compatible with all node versions, detects your node version and exposes the correct hooks API</li>
<li>Node's new API currently only available in node v17 nightly builds</li>
<li>Node will eventually backport the changes to node 16, and may also be backport to 14 and 12</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Add <code>--emit</code> to <code>--help</code> output (<a href=""LINK <a href=""LINK <a href=""LINK
</ul>
<p><strong>Changed</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When ts-node is registered and other libraries <code>require('source-map-support')</code>, they will be redirected to <code>@cspotcode/source-map-support</code>
<ul>
<li>See complete description in <strong>Fixed</strong> section below</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fixed</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fix <a href=""LINK <a href=""LINK <a href=""LINK <a href=""LINK Incorrect stack traces when third-party libraries use <code>source-map-support</code> instead of <code>@cspotcode/source-map-support</code> (<a href=""LINK <a href=""LINK <a href=""LINK <a href=""LINK <a href=""LINK <a href=""LINK <a href=""LINK <a href=""LINK
<ul>
<li>When ts-node is registered and other libraries <code>require('source-map-support')</code>, they will be redirected to <code>@cspotcode/source-map-support</code></li>
<li>ts-node uses <code>@cspotcode/source-map-support</code> for the fixes and enhancements listed here: <a href=""LINK changelog</a></li>
<li>To ensure correct stack traces, all libraries must share a compatible sourcemap support implementation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fix <a href=""LINK REPL may erroneously combine previous input with next input, eval both as a single statement (<a href=""LINK <a href=""LINK <a href=""LINK
<ul>
<li>For example, entering <code>100</code> on first line and <code>* 2</code> on second line would erronously be interpreted as <code>100 * 2</code></li>
<li>REPL now ensures both lines are separate statements, both when typechecking and when evaluating</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fix <a href=""LINK Node may log &quot;circular dependency&quot; warning when using <code>allowJs</code> (<a href=""LINK <a href=""LINK
<li>Fix <a href=""LINK Filter empty strings from <code>TS_NODE_IGNORE</code> and <code>TS_NODE_IGNORE_DIAGNOSTICS</code>; treat empty environment variable as empty array (<a href=""LINK <a href=""LINK <a href=""LINK
<ul>
<li><code>TS_NODE_IGNORE= ts-node ./example.ts</code> will disable default ignore rules; will compile files in <code>./node_modules</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Docs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Update VSCode debug configuration (<a href=""LINK (<a href=""LINK
<li>Update ESM-related messaging to clarify that experimental status is due to Node.js, not ts-node (<a href=""LINK
<li>Refer to ts-node consistently (<a href=""LINK <a href=""LINK
</ul>
<p><a href=""LINK

2658,puppeteer/puppeteer,anjackson,fix: ensure incognito sessions obey proxy server settings (#7589),"<!-- Thanks for submitting a pull request! Please provide enough information so that others can review your pull request. -->

This attempts to resolve issue #7589 - i.e. it's a bug fix because as of 10.4.0 Puppeteer will ignore proxy settings when using incognito sessions.

<!-- E.g. a bugfix, feature, refactoring, build related change, etc… -->

No tests added. It would be good to have a test that would spot this kind of regression, but it is beyond my abilities to create such a test. (I am not really much of a JavaScript programmer).  Issue #7589 includes an example that fails under 10.4.0, ...TBC...

**Summary**

<!-- Explain the **motivation** for making this change. What existing problem does the pull request solve? -->
<!-- Try to link to an open issue for more information. -->

This PR attempts to repair an accidental breaking change introduced in 10.4.0.

<!-- If this PR introduces a breaking change, please describe the impact and a migration path for existing applications. -->

Network.responseReceived in favor of Network.responseReceivedExtraInfo.
However, Puppeteer can't use responseReceivedExtraInfo because
not every responseReceived comes with a corresponding ExtraInfo.

In LINK I am adding a flag to responseReceived to
let us know if there is a corresponding ExtraInfo event. With this
information, Puppeteer can wait to emit its response event until the
ExtraInfo has arrived.

**What kind of change does this PR introduce?**

Clarifies an external source in docs (README.md).

**Did you add tests for your changes?**

not applicable

**If relevant, did you update the documentation?**

not applicable

**Summary**

The URL LINK is mentioned around the top of `README.md` even if it is running a very outdated version (v1.4.0). I suggest either (1) remove it from the docs or (2) putting a warning that it is a bit outdated.  
I made a suggestion for the latter in this PR.

**Does this PR introduce a breaking change?**

no

**Other information**

There has been a [question](LINK about a try-puppeteer issue on SO that I partially try to address with this warning text. Some might think that it is maintained and upgraded in parallel with Puppeteer.",2

2752,animate-css/animate.css,joeworkman,Added missing to opacity 1 for entrance animations,"I am triggering animations via JS once the element scrolls into view. For most entrance animations, this means that I need to add `opacity:0` to the element so that we do not see the elements until I trigger the animation. 

Several of the entrance animations stopped animating opacity part way through the animation. Therefore, this would generate a flash during from where `opacity:1` was set until the end of the animation. The fix was simply to make sure that the opacity is set to 1 all the way to the end of the animation inside of the `to` block. ",1

2754,animate-css/animate.css,daneden,Update LICENSE,"It was recently brought to my attention that Animate.css was used on a website soliciting tips for abortion bounties in Texas, where recent legislation outlawed safe access to abortion.

Abortion is a form of healthcare, and as such is a fundamental human right. By introducing this legislation, lawmakers in Texas are removing the bodily autonomy of women and endangering their well-being by forcing them to seek potentially unsafe alternatives.

Amnesty International [states](LINK
> Access to safe abortion services is a human right. Under international human rights law, everyone has a right to life, a right to health, and a right to be free from violence, discrimination, and torture or cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.

Removal of access to abortion is one thing, but rewarding bounties for disclosure of information about women seeking abortions puts them in immense physical danger and is itself a violation of their human rights.

Not only this, but these legal changes are unconstitutional and the changes themselves violate international UN Human Rights laws. 

The [Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)](LINK Article 21, Section 3 states:
> The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government

More than 60% of Americans believe people should be able to obtain abortions in the first trimester of pregnancy ([source](LINK and the current presidential administration have [themselves stated](LINK that abortion rights are “non-negotiable”.

I want to make it clear to the Animate.css community and the people who use Animate.css for their work and projects that we take a firm stance in support of women’s bodily autonomy and other forms of human rights, and do not permit the use of Animate.css on any project that impedes on these rights. To this end, I plan to update Animate.css’s license to the [Hippocratic License](LINK a variation of the currently-used MIT licence which also bans the use of licensed software in projects that violate human rights.",2

</blockquote>
<pre><code>Discovered by Yeting Li, c/o Colin Ife via Snyk.io.
<p>A ReDos (Regular Expression Denial of Service) vulnerability
was responsibly disclosed to me via email by Colin on
Mar 5 2021 regarding an exponential time complexity for
linearly increasing input lengths for <code>hwb()</code> color strings.</p>
<p>Strings reaching more than 5000 characters would see several
milliseconds of processing time; strings reaching more than
50,000 characters began seeing 1500ms (1.5s) of processing time.</p>
<p>The cause was due to a the regular expression that parses
hwb() strings - specifically, the hue value - where
the integer portion of the hue value used a 0-or-more quantifier
shortly thereafter followed by a 1-or-more quantifier.</p>
<p>This caused excessive backtracking and a cartesian scan,
resulting in exponential time complexity given a linear
increase in input length.</p>
<p>Thank you Yeting Li and Colin Ife for bringing this to my
attention in a secure, responsible and professional manner.</p>
<p>A CVE will not be assigned for this vulnerability.

<h2>1.5.4 (Patch Release)</h2>

<li>Removes rounding of alpha values in RGBA hex (<code>#rrggbbaa</code>) and condensed-hex (<code>#rgba</code>) parsers, which caused certain unique inputs to result in identical outputs (see <a href=""LINK
