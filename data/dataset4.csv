22,httpie/httpie,isidentical,core: support custom request/response classes,"While playing with a 3rd party extension (httpie-gssapi), I've noticed that it sometimes get broken due to the hard-coded `requests` classes. `requests` plugins like `requests-gssapi` might return different type of request/response classes like [requests_gssapi.gssapi_.SanitizedResponse](LINK which makes sense depending on the use case. But since some of the places within `httpie` hard codes this, it is impossible to get around of it (it uses `type(message)` instead of `isinstance()` etc. checks). 

This patch simply abstracts request/response inference to it's own unit, and simplifies this process by changing the default type resolution from bare `type()` checks to `isinstance()` checks so all classes of the `reqeusts.Response` and `requests.PreparedRequest` will be supported with this.",2

    'array[]:=3' \                              # Array — append (third item)
    'wow[such][deep][3][much][power][!]=Amaze'  # Nested object

The `encoding` is suitable for use as a `Content-Encoding` header.

This change introduces graceful handling for scenarios when
requests.models.Response.raw is not urllib3.HTTPResponse. In such a scenario
httpie now falls back to extracting metadata from requests.models.Response
directly instead of direct access from protected protected members such as
response.raw._original_response. A side effect in this fallback procedure is
that we can no longer determine HTTP protocol version and report it as `??`.

Python 3.10 changed the repr of enum members, and the doctest of tests.utils.http failed.

97,httpie/httpie,BoboTiG,Add --data-raw argument to POST data,"A first draft for `curl --data-raw` support. It would close #534.

Notes:
1. `--data-raw` has been chosen because it is the one from `curl --data-raw` we are emulating here.
2. I wanted to use a short argument version, like `-d`, but it is already used for `--download, -d`. I initially used `-D`, and can restore it if you prefer.
   A possible solution would be to rename `--download, -d` to `--download, -dl`, but it may not be possible due to possible breakings everywhere :)
   I thought we could go with `-D` and then it would be kind of logic to use `--data-binary, -Db` later.
3. No need to implement `curl --data-urlencode 'name=I am Daniel'` as it is implicitely handled.
4. That PR does not handle `curl --data 'birthyear=1905&press=OK'`.
5. That PR does not handle `curl --data-binary ''`.

### Key problems:
- A lot of commas printed poorly in this set of pages, and I've had to occasionally had to rely on context to figure it out, especially [page 23](LINK (R0836 and R0868), [page 26](LINK (R0937 R0945), [page 27](LINK (R0967).
- There were also some extremely poorly printed `O`s, some of which could possibly be mistyped `D`s (including on [page 15](LINK at R0612 and R0576).
- It looks like `V41N72` was misspelt as `V4IN72` on [page 23](LINK at R0851, so I've (un)corrected the code to match.",15

I've aligned each of the columns *precisely* with the source, since it's all a long comment.

There's a `D` on [page 5](LINK at [R0122](LINK (L176 in the PR) which looks a lot like an `O`. I've left it as a `D` because it's not clear that it's a typo in the source, rather than a poorly-printed `D`.

I've treated indentation and empty lines within comment blocks the same as in #782.

The only major concerns were:

1. At [5513](LINK ([page 633](LINK it looks like `RA1` has been misspelt in the comment as `RAI`. I've corrected it, but I'm not completely 100% confident the character is a letter `I` instead of a poorly-printed digit `1`
2. At [5769](LINK and [5783](LINK  (both on [page 638](LINK the code has a (subroutine?) named `K10RK2`, however looking at both places in the scan, I'm pretty confident it's the letter `O` and not the digit `0`. I've corrected it to be `K1ORK2` in both places.

A couple of notes while reviewing my PR:

## White space
I tried to match the indentation and white space *exactly*, which means that many paragraphs begin with `\t   ` (3 spaces).  You can see this when looking at line 420 of the file, and comparing it to page 1120 in the Comanche scans.  The leading ""S"" is over the ""D"" in the following line, and looking down, over the ""L"" in the word ""LAST"" for the code.

The entire file seems to follow this convention, but while the previous 419 lines are said to have been proofed, this is not reflected in the file.  Looking back 1 page, and at line 387, it should be indented, and is not.  Just giving reviewers a heads-up and if you want my version reverted I will.  If you want the rest of the file changed to match let me know and I'll make another PR with those changes.

Also, there is some indentation-fiddly-ness that exists starting on line 551; page 1125, and the same thing happens starting on 650; page 1128.  Tabs followed by spaces to get letters to line up properly.

## Bad code?
Starting at line 662; page 1128 there is this code:

```agc
		# Was CAF --- RSB 2009.
		CA	0		# GET BASE ADDRESS OF CADR LIST.
```

If you look at the scan though, the code should be:

```agc
		CAF	0		# GET BASE ADDRESS OF CADR LIST.
```

I don't know enough about AGC assembler to know if this is a bug that was fixed and needs to remain different from the scans, __or__ if someone thought it was a bug, changed it, and now the running code doesn't match the scans and the original.  I am more than happy to change it to match the scan, but I didn't want to change a bugfix and potentially reintroduce such a thing to the system (as there may be people running this code).

Thank you for your time, and please let me know if there are any changes that should be made.",1

1. I used the white space conventions listed in CONTRIBUTING.md, namely:
  * Single space for new words.
  * Double space for new sentences.
  * Triple space for indentations.

I call this out specifically because the scans (at least for this file) seem to use 4 spaces for indentation and 3 spaces for new sentences.  For example, in the following image the leading `C` in `CDUTRIG` would be over the `I` in `COSINES` if it used 3 spaces instead of 4, but instead it is over the `E`.  Similarly, on the 4th line (there's and example on the 3rd but it's easier to see on the 4th) the period at the end of the line corresponds to a space above it, and then there are 3 spaces before the `T` in `THESE` starts.

2. Some of the code seem to use spaces and tabs instead of just tabs.  I mentioned it in the issue here: LINK so I won't repeat myself.
