The `reduce` method was causing 2 of the 3 scripts that were required to be placed into the body rather than the head. By swapping it out for the `join` method, all 3 of the scripts now are in the head which has also fixed the erroneous commas in the output. 

The reason this was only occurring on specific challenges was that only a limited number of challenges require external scripts in their `meta.json` files.

<!--If your pull request closes a GitHub issue, replace the XXXXX below with the issue number.-->

Currently, `username` indexing is wonky, because the user state object literal is always lowercase.

- Seeing as the DB has `username` and `usernameDisplay`, I added `usernameDisplay` to the client.
- `usernameDisplay` is **not used for any logic** - it is just for displaying
- Campers cannot change `username` to anything that exists`.toLowerCase()`
  - E.g. you **cannot** change your `usernameDisplay` to `sKy020`, because I own `sky020`
  - I **can** change my `usernameDisplay` to `sKy020`, because I own `sky020`
    - Technically, `username` has not changed, in this example

**FAQ**

Q: What does this fix?
A: One: it aligns the client closer to the DB again. Two: currently a user who has CAPS in their username encounters many bugs, because of `user[username]` indexing

Q: Does this PR break production?
A: Almost most definitely 😃 ",12

After discussion with @ojeytonwilliams, we decided to extract this from #44183 into it's own PR.

This PR adds an env value that can be used as a feature-flag to gate the new curriculum. Currently this feature flag does absolutely nothing, but will be integrated into the above PR to allow us to control the deployment of the new curriculum - The goal here is to be able to display the new curriculum on English, but not on i18n deployments until we begin translating.",1

This removes `normalize.css`. I checked a few projects/lessons, and see no detrimental side affects, but, I did not check in Safari so... 🤷‍♂️ 

The main thing this fixes is lessons like `registration-form/part-008`, where before, there was no visual change, but now there is.",2

Added 3 new sections to FAQ.md to help both new and experienced OSS contributors. 

“What do I need to know to contribute to the codebase”, seemed like a worthy addition to the page because it lists out all the technologies that this project uses. So, anyone that skipped directly to the FAQ page of the contributor’s documentation will be able to see this important information right away. 

“Can I contribute articles to freeCodeCamp News or videos to freeCodeCamp’s YouTube channel”, also seemed like a good addition to me because it offered another way for potential contributors to get involved if they do not want to contribute directly to the codebase or translate freeCodeCamp’s learning platform. The publication guide and the YouTube channel guide are both hidden in the articles section of freeCodeCamp but are well written and are certainly important enough to be on the FAQ. 

“How can I help review Pull Requests that are ready for quality assurance and approval?”, could be extremely helpful for more experienced but new to the community OSS contributors that want to review Pull Requests for quality assurance. ",8

员工可以通过这个项目了解到公司管理制度是否合理，自己是否被PUA，被PUA了怎么处理。企业可以通过这个项目了解自身管理有什么问题，怎么样提高管理水平。职场小白可以通过这个项目迅速进化为熟知职场文化的“白骨精”（白领+骨干+精英），让职场PUA的企业和领导竞争力下降，被淘汰。让管理优秀的企业脱颖而出，慢慢提高管理优秀企业在所有企业中的占比。最终打败PUA！

只有从理论上打败996PUA，才能真正打败PUA，希望能像《论持久战》一样，成为击败PUA的理论依据。

118,996icu/996.ICU,alexgit886,996.ICU是一种高明的奴役方式,"为啥朝廷对 996 的【维权】问题，不太关心？
这里面当然有很多原因，俺简单聊几个
========
1、
大部分劳工（包括白领＆蓝领）都缺乏足够的【系统性思考】。
因此，当他们遭到 996 制度的压榨/剥削，他们的怨气和矛头，对准的是【本公司的资本家】。
大多数人【不会】想到“政治体制”（再次唠叨：大部分人缺乏【系统性思考】）
2、
当这些人把怨气和矛头对准【本公司的资本家】。对朝廷而言，相当于【转移矛盾焦点】。
通俗地说，这样一种倾向，对朝廷而言是【有利】滴。
3、
与多数人的直觉相反——朝廷非但不会对抗“996制度”，反而会纵容这种制度。
（当然啦，政府官员会象征性地谴责一下996，表示一下姿态，仅此而已）
实际上，某些权贵会希望：黑心资本家压榨得更狠一些。
为啥捏？
在博文《每周转载：内卷的天朝，各阶层的众生相（网文17篇）》中，俺写了如下这段：
天朝的特色是：先通过洗脑，让大多数人都认同某个【高度一元化】的评价体系，于是大多数人都愿意为该评价体系内的某个目标付诸毕生的努力。当绝大部分人的目标高度【同质化】，就如同大部分人都挤在同一个赛道上，自然会有【无谓的内耗】——这就是“内卷”的根源。
　　通过这种方式，极少数人（权贵）可以实现对大多数人的【奴役】。而大多数人深深地陷入“内卷”的困境（陷入内耗），当然没有精力去思考为啥他们会深陷这种困境。如果他们没有精力去思考，就更加不可能去反抗。
　　不得不感叹：这是一种高明的奴役方式！

上述这3段话虽然说的是“内卷”这个话题；但后面的2段话，也可以套用到“996”。

补充说明：
对于上述所说的 第3点，大伙儿如果不相信的话，可以回顾一下前两年（2019）发生的【996.ICU 事件】。
这个搭建在 Github 上的项目，已经引发的极大的关注。
结果如何捏？真理部对这个网站进行【全网封杀】。
如果朝廷真的想要解决“996 制度”，如果真的想要帮天朝的打工族维权，【996.ICU 事件】是一个很好的契机。
而真理部的所做作为，已经间接反应了朝廷的立场。",1

「看完这本书就像做了一场大梦一样。说它是梦，是因为梦到了过去；但它又不太像梦，虽然长
长的五六十年给它蒙上了一层惝恍迷离的薄雾轻纱，它毕竟还是太真实了。收在书中的上百篇文章
和几十幅图片几乎都是我自己曾一字一句看过读过并且宣传过的。这些文章、讲话、文件都发表在
1941年到1946年，正好是我上大学到参加工作的时代。我领导当时的抗日民主学生运动时，这些
文章就是我们的口号和纲领。抗战胜利后我到了《新华日报》，由于是新手，那时还轮不上我写这书
里所收的文章。我现在已无法辨认这书里的哪篇文章是谁写的了，但我还能记忆起这些文章的作者
们的音容笑貌来，他们大多已经过世：范剑涯、钟颖、陈驰、邹适今......；且不说名气要大得多的领
导人潘梓年、章汉夫、张友渔、夏衍......；当然还有至今还活在中国人民记忆中的毛泽东和周恩来。

我自己当时是个左派青年，而且是其中的积极分子，是学生运动活跃的组织者。我完全信奉毛
泽东、共产党提出的一切口号、一切理论，虽然我在国民党统治下并没有经历过什么大的危险，然
而主观上确也是舍生忘死地愿意为其实现而奋斗的。现在重读这本书的时候，简直不知道心头是什
么滋味。是我骗了人吗?从这本书上所写的一切和我当时的言行来看，对比后来的历史事实，我无法
逃避骗人的责任。但又是谁骗了我呢?这本书的副标题是“半个世纪前的庄严承诺”。这难道也是我
干过的事吗?不错，我是向我的同龄人或者行辈稍晚于我的人宣传过“黄金世界的预约券”的，但是
微末如我，难道敢说自己曾作了庄严的承诺吗?这样说不是自我膨胀得没了边了吗?我倒是想忏悔，
但是我配吗?」── 李慎之

整理一下从去年至今的slack群内管理和群友组织的几次活动
1.向全国各地企业邮寄劳动法
结果：企业根本不当回事，可能我们的效果与影响力还不如送错快递的邮政员

2.要求全国劳动部门提供当地维权记录，如不配合则直接起诉
结果: 除了几个比较配合的地区，有些地方甚至有你有本事来告的意思，随后的正规起诉流程也在一个月又一个月的等待中慢慢凉了。

3. 组织选出年度996最差公司投票运动
结果：没足够的人参与

其他更小规模打打闹闹的不做统计

很多人觉得，既然国家官媒发言了，那么大家到处呼吁一下，企业家们就应该胆小的放弃加班压榨行为，而国家管理部门就应该会非常配合大家的维权活动。而同胞们也理应一呼百应。
现实情况是：社会管理中，管理部门其实是很懒政的，他们天天965舒舒服服过日子何必为了一群敲代码的家伙加班呢？而从企业家的角度，这些闹腾的影响无非就是增加点公关成本，无非就是对996改个说辞，现在就新增了712 715的新模式，毕竟搞IT的总归是要吃饭的。舆情管理部门甚至认为996运动会影响社会稳定，直接对996的新闻信息进行控评处理。
很多城市为了发展，甚至会默许996的行为，因为他们会带动城市的GDP，某些城市甚至会放任一些互联网企业对员工的压榨。让劳动监察部门对其放任，说的就是你杭州。同时华为251事件中，有关部门甚至站在流氓企业一方抹杀我们的发言。
其他行业的就业者甚至对咱们冷嘲热讽，
搬砖和车间的民工全月无休都扛下来了，你们写代码才996就闹腾，太娇嫩了。

其次，这种劳动维权的运动，本质应该是在配合国家现行法律的前提下针对企业的维权行为，结果过程中却被带节奏石梯搞成要对体制变革的行为，
甚至有人认为我们应该从头组建独立的工会，麻烦你们了解一下2018年的佳士事件吧。国家不会允许这种工会存在的。即便我们自己要组织，我们目前也没有成立独立工会的筹码。相对于不愿意让民众抱团的有关部门来说，一无所有的我们目前太过于弱势。

请大家都清醒一下，诸位只是在国内就业的从业者，不是革命家。更不是政治家。
既然目前的劳动法已经做出了对劳动者有利的纸面规则，那么就应该利用这些有利的规则，而不是应该是颠覆规则。大家没有那个本事和能力。也无法控制过度影响的后果。再说了这么折腾让上头那些大佬怎么给我们政策上的帮助啊，还不第一时间给维稳了？


最后，也是我们都犯的一个最严重的错误，大家根本没有发挥作为技术人员的职业优势，实际上去年的一些活动组织与过去的民工讨薪没有任何的区别。居然想通过游行啊，罢工啊，仲裁啊，这些企业家们早就拥有应对方法的行为来维权？
几个典型的例子，华为251事件，为了应对员工索要N+2赔偿，他们直接将维权员工以诽谤罪下狱，而上个月的开除孕妇事件，华为直接将离职原因修改为主动离职。让怀孕的员工连失业金都拿不到。腾讯清退35岁员工事件，为了防止员工维权，他们直接删除了996加班时期晚上6点以后的视频记录。然后以缺勤为由开除。
这种行为只会让我们实际行动上与过去的民工讨薪一样没什么区别。
如果我们继续像普通劳动者一样去做一些企业家早就预判到的行为，我们只会落入死循环中，最后身心疲惫。

可能过去唯一一点的好处是企业不敢公然宣布996了，求职的时候都偷偷摸摸的说我们要加班。然而很多企业公然推出了712和715工作制挑战大众的底线。

那么大家就应该放弃了么？过去一年所做的就没有任何意义吗？并不是……

如果把整个996icu作为一个系统项目
过去一年，大家的行动其实是有意义的，在大家不断的试错中，探索和分析出项目大概的需求。
一，流氓企业不害怕什么？
抗议维权，仲裁，起诉法院，甚至邮寄劳动法这些不疼不痒的行为，流氓企业都拥有详尽的应对措施
实际上除了仲裁能为我们拿到一点补偿外，其他的他们都不在乎，这还得基于取证完善的前提下
因此我们将仲裁行为保留，其他行为踢出今后的计划

二、大家还拥有那些对流氓企业有利的手段
1. 求职选择权，大家在求职中拥有对企业拒绝的权利，如果求职者对企业在求职前就有了深刻的了解，提前知晓了企业过去的一些缺点，例如过度加班，无加班费，强制迫害员工等，那么员工有资格拒绝企业的面试邀约。流氓企业没有资格按着我们的手强迫签字，这是黑工行为，违反刑法。

2. 辞职选择权，当大家在企业中遭遇到不符合劳动法的流氓行为时，大家可以主动提出辞职及时止损，按照劳动法，以及仲裁委，监察大队咨询到的信息，员工提出离职后1个月，企业必须无条件解除关系。如果有拖延阻碍甚至强迫行为，大家可以通过劳动仲裁来保证部分自己应得的损失赔偿。至少目前仲裁庭还是站在劳动者角度来维权的，如果部分地区人社部不会继续装死的话。

3. 仲裁维权（被削弱）,当大家遭遇到开除等企业强制解除劳动合同行为时，我们可以通过仲裁拿到一点补偿金。
这还是我们取证完善，能够利于仲裁作证，企业不会下黑手段耍流氓的前提下。对于华为这类大型企业基本无效，他们有足够的律师团队能够长期的和我们打官司。（网易驱逐患病员工时曾威胁上诉拖几年。活活拖死员工）


三、流氓企业害怕什么？
整理一下，996icu项目已经被流氓企业针对过的举动
1.996.icu域名被各大国产浏览器拉黑，导致只能通过chrome和firefox浏览器访问。 996icu 被各大新闻媒体控评
很可能流氓企业害怕 github 项目带来的影响力。所以通过其公关和自身企业技术手段对其进行限流
2. 996icu失踪（假定其已经被抄水表）
996icu本人失踪后，github项目的merge操作已经被停止.至今大家所pull的企业黑名单记录已经无法合并。流氓企业的意图，可能是妨碍我们继续补充完善企业黑名单。借此打击士气。

总结以上三大类情况，大体上996icu项目的需求大概方向应该为
针对企业所害怕的行为，让所有求职者能够保证自己的利益。
**我们应该将主要方向，放在大家求职前的预防上**


具体的应该如何实现需求呢？
应该参考和学习我们的敌人，流氓企业所使用过的手段。
例如：阳光诚信联盟，
[LINK
互通有无
[LINK
虽然是打着拉黑腐败员工的旗号，实际上目前此套黑名单已经被运作于hr和企业老板针对员工的打击报复上。
这套针对求职者的黑名单系统，目前已经存在多个不对外公开的版本，大量企业的人力，在大家不知情的前提下，将你们的信息在上面分门别类，并标记上侮辱性的标签。甚至连求职网站也在对人力和猎头提供这种功能便于方便企业筛选员工。

但是，虽然这种恶心人的筛选方法对大家非常不利，我们不妨也学习利用他们的方法，反向的，对企业进行分类统计。毕竟相对于数以万计的求职者来说，企业，被更多的条件和规则所约束，被更多的媒体，甚至信息渠道所监督，大家可以通过自己的亲身经历，新闻，甚至脉脉，知乎等沟通渠道，更广泛的获取整理集中这些企业的信息。

在此必须提及一下，在今年有一个很让企业忌惮的活动，可能有些人已经关注到并且也在参与了。就是各省求职者慎重公司参考名单。

而这套文档的部分维护者也曾经到996icu的slack群内做客，这位大佬认为维权应该帮助所有行业的人，而不是仅仅为信息工作者服务（膜拜orz）。这点看来比996icu的初衷高尚不少。
很不幸的是，因为群内人员管理导致泄露资料问题，大佬生气退群。（再次万分抱歉orz）

而这套文档曝光时，因为其影响力开始提升，企业下黑手段对其在线文档进行不断举报甚至攻击篡改其内容。
因此这个模式可以归类到流氓企业害怕什么的分类中。

可以确定，流氓企业害怕求职者整理流氓企业的大数据黑名单，并对其他求职者，特别是毕业生们进行宣传，让他们提前拥有求职的参考信息，对不良企业进行拒绝与拉黑，流氓企业最终还是不能逼迫没签合同的人来自己企业被剥削的。
它们越害怕的东西，反而是我们越需要掌握和研究的，因为这样，才能保证我们拥有与之对抗的筹码。


至此，需求大概已经比较清晰了：
一、对我们唯一有利的是已经成文的劳动法。但是不能过度指望国家管理部门会主动的遵从劳动法保护劳动者的权益，我们没有资格和权力，以及权利要求有关部门为我们做事。我们必须放弃通过游行抗议等行为，强求有关部门刻意帮助维权的幻想

二、大家需要发挥自己作为信息技术从业者的优势，从代码开发，系统运维，网络安全预防，大数据挖掘分析，网络爬虫等方向挖掘出一切对企业不利的信息，将其整合统计成企业黑名单大数据系统，并通过各种企业无法对其举报，黑客攻击，干扰，部分有关部门无法对其拥有管辖权的方式，对外提供查询，新增的接口，持续的维护下去。将其作为996icu项目今后的方向。
帮助广大的求职者作为求职更换工作的信息参考。发挥求职者求职的选择权，规避流氓企业，并通过人际交流对毕业生推广。
甚至可以作为仲裁维权的宣传渠道。通过协助传播的方式迫使流氓企业不敢进行打击报复。

三、**996icu所针对的对象，不能再局限于互联网企业为主的IT企业，而应该针对一切行业存在违反劳动法恶意压榨迫害员工的企业，同时针对的行为也不能局限于996行为，应该升级到职场PUA，违法犯罪，克扣工资，恶性加班等所有违反劳动法，压迫压榨员工的流氓企业行为，同时数据信息应该对各行各业的求职者开放**
这样做，其一不会让IT工作者的维权行为遭遇到其他行业工作者的歧视，导致最终被孤立，其二可以从整体上改善就业环境，不会在未来因为维权有效导致IT从业者成为所有行业的特权群体，导致最终被仇视。
我们应当利用自己技术人员的能力，为全国各行各业的维权者提供有利的技术支持。

四、**996icu活动存在的意义，是以遵守《中华人民共和国劳动法》基础上进行，记录统计流氓企业的目的，是为了帮助求职者不会遭遇到企业违反劳动法的伤害，甚至可以作为协助国内劳动仲裁部门和劳动纠察部门提高劳动维权效率的存在。而不能本着恶意目的去颠覆破坏良性就业环境。**
因此系统记录信息的目的只可用于维权公示和求职预防。（必要时搞搞挂城墙活动羞辱流氓企业）

五、因为过去有关部门针对996icu项目各种不友好的针对措施，以及部分地方政府对996流氓企业的偏袒行为，根据996icu本人被抄水表，以及华为251等事件中有关部门不作为甚至为虎作伥的前车之鉴，更有必要把部分有关部门例如网信办作为敌人来看待并提防
大家虽然是在通过996icu运动维护《中华人民共和国劳动法》的权威，但是不能对有关部门给予无限的信任。
因此今后996icu的一切讨论活动，数据存储，和程序部署维护，都必须在灰色地带中进行，在未来，996icu运动必须通过灰色地带的灰色方式，寻求黑暗的公正。
除非有关部门对国内劳动者释放落实实际法律措施的善意，并建立持续从严整治华为阿里等流氓企业的案例，才能对其给予有限的信任甚至合作。

针对企业的大数据查询和录入接口已经大概有个雏形。鉴于过去996icu那些失败的项目和大佬们遭遇到的黑手段，可能机器人的方式基于灰色渠道录入和提供数据才是比较安全的。进群请大家保持匿名不要使用国内邮箱注册。
感谢持续不断与闹翻脸的大佬沟通的弟兄，总算拿到了部分各省求职者慎重公司参考名单的数据，以及访问资格。希望大佬们未来自己构思的系统平台也能成功上线。
感谢在业余时间帮助开发bot，并持续不断整理数据，和录入数据的朋友们。大家能力都有限，算不上大佬，但是都在坚持。

目前已经收集有1000多家企业，的2000多份评论，数据还在持续添加中。
希望仍在关注996icu的朋友们，能够坚持下来，并加入到未来的活动中。

很遗憾这pr因为不少有其他目的的人乱刷不得不关了

996icu活动至今也有近一年
目前相信很多人都灰心丧气.认为活动失败了.自己还是不得不加班
也相信很多黑心企业家开始幸灾乐祸.认为今后可以明目张胆的开始奋斗逼式宣传

因此, 我们在今年3-4月.
即996icu运动一周年之际
组织996年度黑心企业评奖活动
目前,已经在官方slack频道开建了 ""996年度评奖""频道专门用户讨论和组织该活动
尚未加入频道的,请马上加入
链接在介绍里
这里是另一个链接LINK

活动目的,  是以年度评奖的模式,对去年(也可以说是今后的每一年)的重大事件做一个回顾和统计
让大家保留对996icu运动的信心
让求职的广大IT行业从业者,以及高校毕业生们有一个入职参考
让那些无视国家劳动法甚至刑法的企业甚至城市, 心生畏惧.
只要是IT行业的人
程序员,系统运维工程师, 网络工程师,测试工程师, 都有资格参与,你们都是技术企业必不可少的职业组成,大家都是一个利益共同体.

活动计划分为以下几步:

第一步: 人手召集
评奖必须需要大量人员参与,  最小预估不得少于400人.所以如果你们现在还在打酱油. AFK
请马上回归slack群. 并赶紧通知你已经A了.或者被迫加班的朋友
PS: 人数如果不达标活动就得中止了 汗~~

第二步: 信息收集
在人员数量足够的前提下,统计去年所有的996事件.记住是所有的
包括
企业公开支持996
恶性加班导致的猝死事件
企业以不加班为由故意裁员
企业暴力裁员清退为企业加班过的老员工
等等事件.
因为目前996信息被人为限制屏蔽,我们必须得通过最原始的方式收集统计
信息来源可以是新闻, 996icublacklist, 去年重大话题, slack 和 discord群内曝光的事件信息.
作为评奖参考 
所有事件必须来源清晰.
(希望能以此基础,形成今后的996大数据.)

第三步:奖项确定
根据去年所有事件的典型特点,确定评选奖项
例如
最差求职企业
996城(996企业比率最多的城市)
具体奖项请加入 996年度评奖频道讨论

第四步:投票
每个奖项首先SLACK频道内选出5个最典型 投票对象
然后通过PR的形式,在996icu github内,让大家投票(以表情符号反馈的形式)


第五步:奖项宣传
在知乎.bilibili等网站.或其他合作子媒体.以视频,文章讨论等形式对外宣传.

以上为初步计划活动步骤,大家可以加入slack频道完善.

如果这次活动成功,我们希望能够将此办成一个一年一度的长期活动",1

160,996icu/996.ICU,chinyichun,“996工作制”只不过是【劫贫济富】的缩影——“马云奇葩言论”随想,"★引子

　　这次的“996.ICU 事件”闹得很大，连朝廷喉舌都出来发话了。尤其是马云发表了一些奇葩的言论，把此事的热度推到了一个新的高度。

★“共同奋斗”的口号，大部分情况是【忽悠和洗脑】

　　相当比例的资本家都喜欢用“共同奋斗”（或诸如此类）的口号来激励员工。这个口号相当于古典小说中常见的“有难同当，有福同享”。
　　问题在于：当企业将来做大做强之后，到了“共富贵”的时候，到了需要“分蛋糕”的时候，老板是否愿意跟底下的员工一起分蛋糕，这里面就存在很大的变数。说得夸张一点，这全在老板的【一念之间】。
　　大部分资本家（黑心资本家）从一开始就【没打算】跟员工“共富贵”，只有极少数良心资本家愿意跟下面的员工一起分蛋糕。但不管是“黑心资本家”还是“良心资本家”，一开始都会喊出“共同奋斗”（或诸如此类）的口号。
　　有鉴于此，“共同奋斗”（或诸如此类）的口号，具有很大欺骗性——毕竟，良心资本家本来就是少数（具体到咱们墙内，更加是少数）。

　　所以，【老板的人品】比“口号”更重要；而绝大部分人恰恰在【理解人性】方面非常【幼稚】，总是把“黑心企业家”当成好人。
　　另一个难点在于——就算你能非常准确地判断自己的老板是良心资本家，依然存在【其它变数】——
比如说，当企业做大之后，由于资本运作（或诸如此类的原因），原先的创始老板，其话语权会下降，企业的实际控制人可能改变。新老板未必会兑现旧老板的承诺。

　　综上所述，
　　所有这些“共同奋斗”之类的口号，你听听就算了，不要太当真。【千万不要】把自己未来的希望寄托在这种非常飘渺的东西之上。
　　俺在博文和博客评论区经常唠叨的观点是：
最可靠的东西是你自己的能力（尤其是你的核心竞争力）。

★“996工作制”如何影响你自己的职业生涯？

　　“996工作制”对个人的影响，包括如下几个方面：

◇压缩了员工的业余时间——因此也就减少了你的自学【时间】

　　大多数人都知道——加班意味着业余时间减少。业余时间减少也就意味着：你更加没有时间去自学，去提升自己的能力。
　　如果你的能力得不到提升，你在人力市场上的【议价能力/谈判筹码】也就得不到提升。然后你就不得不继续接受这种变态的工作时间。
　　俺把这称之为【996怪圈】——它是一个恶性循环（恶性正反馈），你陷入其中，并越来越无法自拔。

◇消耗了员工在业余时间的【自控力】——因此也就减少了你的自学【动力】

　　关于“自控力”这个词汇，容易产生歧义。为了避免理解上的出入，建议你先看上个月（2019年3月）的博文：
《为什么独立思考这么难？——谈谈心理学的成因，并分享俺的经验》。
　　首先，大部分人的工作都【不是】自己的兴趣所在。
　　其次，超长的工作时间，使得你必须长时间面对自己不感兴趣的工作内容，所以你必须动用“自控力”以完成自己的工作。
　　最后，当你忙碌了一天，终于回家的时候，很可能你的自控力已消耗殆尽。
　　结论就是：如果你的工作不是你的兴趣所在，长时间加班之后，回到家里，你很难再有动力去学习其它新技能。
　　超长加班导致的【自控力损耗】，同样会让你处于（俺前面提到的）【996怪圈】。

◇对【健康】的负面影响

　　（这方面的弊端，人所共知，俺就不展开啦）

◇对【家庭生活】的负面影响

　　（这方面的弊端，人所共知，俺就不展开啦）

◇如何跳出996的怪圈？

　　看完前面几个小节，肯定会有读者问这个问题。
　　关于这个问题的讨论会比较长，不适合放在这里展开。如果有很多人对此话题感兴趣，可以到博客评论区反馈，到时候俺再另写一篇博文。


★“996工作制”【不】仅仅出现在软件行业

　　（再次强调：本文所说的“996”泛指各种“【常态化】的加班制度”）
　　这次的“996.ICU 事件”，创建于 Github 的项目，2周左右获得【20万】的 star（请注意：只有 Github 帐号才能点赞）
　　考虑到“Github 帐号”的用户，大部分是程序员，这至少说明——在软件开发行业，996 已经非常普遍了。
　　但如果你以为：996工作制只在软件行业才有，那你就犯了【幸存者偏见】的思维谬误（关于这种思维谬误，参见博文《思维的误区：幸存者偏见——顺便推荐巴菲特最著名的演讲》）
　　这次的事件能闹大，全仰仗 Github 这个开源平台。由于这个平台在全球是独一无二滴（墙内的没有同等的替代品），墙内程序员自然也大量使用它。因此，Github 上有很多墙内的程序员用户。而且 Github 位于【墙外】，不受真理部的管辖（朝廷拿它没办法）。
　　相比之下，其它行业虽然也存在类似996的现象，但是其它行业缺少像 Github 这样的平台，所以很多【不满的意见】，无法集中表达，无法成为热点事件，也就无法被各国媒体报道。


★“996工作制”如何影响墙内的人力资源市场？

◇除了“供给和需求”，【博弈】也会影响商品的价格

　　早期的经济学理论认为：“价格”完全是由“供给和需求”决定滴。到了20世纪，超级跨界大牛冯·诺依曼完成了一篇划时代的论文《博弈论与经济行为》，指出了【博弈论】对经济学的重要性。
　　也就是说，不光是商品的“供应量和消费量”会影响商品的价格，供应方和需求方的【博弈】，也会影响商品的价格。
　　下面俺来介绍一下：“996工作制”作为【资方】的博弈工具，是如何影响人力资源价格滴。

◇“996工作制”成为【资方】的博弈工具

　　下面以 IT 行业为例来说明。
　　由于超长加班已经成为行业常态，每个程序员的【工作时间】增加了，每个人的【产出】当然也增加了。于是，同样的工作量，只需要【更少】的人就可以完成。
　　也就是说，同一个公司，如果公司本身的业务没有显著变化，延长每个员工的劳动时间，公司老板对人员数量的需求就【减少】了，所以，资本家就获得了【更强】的议价能力。这至少体现如下几方面：
　　其一，对企业内的员工
　　由于需求的人数降低了，资方可以拿【裁员】进行威胁（当然啦，不会说得这么难听，会美其名曰“末位淘汰”）。从而进一步迫使员工付出更多劳动（比如更长的加班），并进一步减少成本（比如取消加班工资）
　　其二，对人力市场上的应聘者
　　资方可以进一步压价（尤其是针对刚毕业的新手）
　　其三，正反馈
　　只要某个行业中的【标志性企业】都这么干（比如“腾讯、阿里、百度、华为”就是软件行业的标杆），同一行业的其它小公司肯定纷纷效仿（这么好的赚钱机会，资本家又不傻，当然不会错过）。如此一来，就形成了某种【正反馈】。

　　综上所述，996之类的工作制越是普及，则行业的【平均工资】水平会被压低。
　　当然啦，“平均工资”这个说法【不能】一概而论。考虑到每一个行业中的岗位，都会有【高/低】之分。俺的观点是：层次越【低】的岗位，越容易受到996工作制的影响，并导致这类岗位的平均薪资水平被压低
　　因为越低层次的岗位，其劳动者的【议价能力】也越低。

◇平均工资到底是上升还是下降？

　　这个问题肯定是有争议滴。
　　由于篇幅的关系，俺不想在这里展开详细讨论，只提几个要点，供参考：
　　其一，
　　前面的讨论有一个前提【公司业务没变化】。在这个前提下，如果延长每个员工的劳动时间，则资方对“员工人数”的需求就会下降。
　　而实际情况是，由于墙内作为【世界工厂】，很多行业的【业务总量】是在增长滴。所以，就要判断“行业的业务增幅”与“行业的工时增幅”哪个更大。如果“业务的增幅”更大，资方对人员数量的需求不但没降低，反而会增加。这种情况下，该行业的平均工资可能会上升；反之，则可能会下降。
　　但是，不管业务的情况如何变化，【增加平均工时】之后，资方的【利润率】显然是变大滴。
　　其二，
　　在讨论“平均工资”的时候，要参考【通胀因素】，否则没有意义。


★为啥有很多知名企业家力挺马云？

　　自从马云发表了那个奇葩言论（能够996是员工的福报），已经引发广泛批评，但是有很多企业家跳出来支持马云。
　　很多人的解读是：屁股决定脑袋，企业家当然是站在资方的立场进行思考。
　　俺觉得以上只是一个方面，另一个方面是：
　　这次的“996.ICU 事件”闹得很大，连很多知名外媒都报道了。这有点出乎资方的意料。考虑到舆论的压力很大，资方代表作人物必须站出来力挺996之类的工作制（表面上是力挺马云，实质上是要维护996制度）。
　　如果资方能安然渡过这次的大风波，今后就算有人再闹，充其量也不过如此。那么，996之类的工作制，将成为各行业的潜规则，【黑心】资本家又多了一个利器。

★为啥“996制度”变得更加普遍？

　　（为了打字省力，本文后续部分以“996”一词指代各种“【常态化】的加班制度”）
　　20多年前，当俺以程序猿的身份刚开始工作时，像996这么变态的工作制，还很少听说；而如今，不要说996，连997都有公司在推行了。
　　很显然，这类变态的加班制度，正变得越来越普遍。

◇“996工作制”是资方的应对措施之一

　　资本家通常不会太傻（太傻的资本家会很快被淘汰），所以他们想出了若干招数来应对劳动力成本上升。
　　对于【体力密集型】的行业（比如某些制造业），可以用“工业自动化”来应对“劳动力成本上升”。但对于【脑力密集型】的行业（比如软件业），【暂时没有】成熟的工业自动化来实现“对人的替代”。所以，资方必须采用其它招数。
　　其中一个招数就是——【大幅延长】劳动时间。在员工人数【不变】的情况下，增加每个员工的工时，社保成本【没有】变，但劳动产出增加了。
　　就算对加班的时间支付“加班费”，增加的劳动产出，还是会显著大于加班费（【净收益】大于零）。有些更加黑心的企业，连加班费也不给，那么【净收益】就更加显著了。

◇劳动力成本上升

　　为啥 996 越来越普遍？这里面当然有很多原因。俺今天只谈其中一个原因，那就是——企业的【劳动力成本】在显著上升，而劳动力成本中，【社保成本】又是其中的主要影响因素。最近这些年，墙内的社保费率一直是【超高】滴！
　　为了强调这点，特地引用官方喉舌“中国新闻网”的报道——《发改委：中国社保费率超美日 应降五险一金减负 @ 中新网》
国家发改委网站公布了来自该委社会发展研究所的研究报告，称当前我国企业职工五项社保总费率为企业职工工资总额的 39.25%
......
目前各地 10% 到 24% 的住房公积金缴费，我国“五险一金”的名义费率已经达到 60% 左右。
　　从上述报道可以看出——连朝廷自己的喉舌，都不得不承认——【社保成本超高】。

◇为啥社保成本持续上升？

　　那么，为啥朝廷要让企业缴纳如此高比例的社保捏？原因同样有很多，俺只谈其中两个原因：
　　其一，公务员队伍
　　墙内有非常庞大的公务员队伍。关于这点，是有目共睹滴。前几年网上流传一篇文章，列举【县一级】的朝廷机构，竟然有【100多个】。单从这点就可以看出——公务员队伍有多么庞大了。
　　另外分享一篇文章：《公务员一辈子不缴社保，退休金却拿最高 @ 凤凰网》。
　　一方面是公务员队伍庞大，另一方面是公务员不缴纳社保。朝廷当然要从私营企业（包括外企）的身上进行搜刮啦。
　　其二，人口结构
　　说到人口红利耗尽，最近几年已经非常明显了（不但新生人口暴跌，劳动力人口也暴跌）。当然啦，这要归功于朝廷那个傻逼的计生政策。这个政策不但傻逼，而且还坚持不懈地搞了40年。

★再来谈谈【工会 & 工运】的问题

　　既然聊到“996工作制”，当然也要顺便谈谈“工会和工运”。
　　在咱们墙内，每一个城市（具体到每一个县和镇），都有【官方的】工会。但所有这些“官方工会”全都是【扯蛋】滴——你千万不要指望官方的工会能帮你维权。
　　在咱们墙内，各级朝廷都讨厌维权。因为任何一个地方出现维权事件，也就意味着这个地方的朝廷出了问题。所以，墙内所有的维权事件，都必然会被【打压】。

　　明白了上述道理，你再去看近期发生的“996.ICU 事件”，就能理解很多奇葩的事情，为啥会发生。
　　比如说：“996.ICU 项目”刚刚引发热议的时候（4月初），多款国产浏览器（至少包括：QQ浏览器、微信浏览器、UC浏览器、360浏览器）同步屏蔽了这个项目的网址。这么多国产浏览器能够统一协调行动，这说明啥捏？这说明了——背后是真理部的旨意。也就是说，真理部是【不】希望 996.ICU 这个事情闹大滴。因为这个事情闹得越大，有关部门就越没有面子。
　　墙内的各级官员更关心自己的面子——因为面子会影响到仕途；至于广大民众的死活，跟他们没有半毛钱关系——因为屁民【无法影响】官员的仕途。


★墙内是哪一种资本主义？

　　去年俺写了一篇博文《相当奇葩的墙内，【劫贫济富】的国度》，里面提到了：三种“财富分配方式”。今天再来老调重弹一下。
　　社会的财富分配方式，大致可以归纳成三种。为了通俗起见，俺分别称之为：
1. 放任自由——朝廷【不】过多地干预社会财富分配
2. 劫富济贫——朝廷通过税收之类的方式，把一部分富人的财富转移到穷人手中
3. 劫贫济富——朝廷通过各种【掠夺】的方式，把一部分穷人的财富转移到富人手中
　　如果把这3种财富分配方式去跟不同类型的资本主义进行关联，那么：
“放任自由” 相当于 “自由资本主义”
“劫富济贫” 相当于 “福利资本主义”
“劫贫济富” 相当于 “权贵资本主义”
（上述这个说法，从政治学理论的角度，肯定是不够严谨滴。考虑到本文只是一篇【通俗性】博文，喜欢较真的同学就不要跟俺抬杠啦）

　　从今天对“996工作制”的讨论，你可以很清楚地看出，墙内就是典型的——【劫贫济富】（这也就是本文标题的由来）。
　　俺已经猜到：某些“职业五毛”或“自干五”会为朝廷辩护，他们会辩称：996是资本家的罪过，与朝廷无关。
　　但如果你再回头去看刚才关于“工会 & 工运”的讨论，自然明白——问题的根源还是出在【朝廷体制】。在如今的墙内，朝廷是站【资方】这边滴。
　　俺经常说：【墙内是个奇葩的国度】，从今天的讨论也可以看出来：一方面，墙内挂的是“马列主义的招牌”；另一方面，墙内的剥削远远胜过欧美那些老牌资本主义国家。
　　是不是很讽刺啊？！

<h3>v3.7.0 2021-07-23</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fix: Use a null prototype object for this.files  (see <a href=""LINK
<ul>
<li>This change might break existing code if it uses prototype methods on the <code>.files</code> property of a zip object, for example <code>zip.files.toString()</code>. This approach is taken to prevent files in the zip overriding object methods that would exist on a normal object.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>v3.6.0 2021-02-09</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fix: redirect main to dist on browsers (see <a href=""LINK

<ul>
<li>No public changes, but a number of testing dependencies have been updated.</li>
<li>Tested browsers are now: Internet Explorer 11, Chrome (most recent) and Firefox (most recent). Other browsers (specifically Safari) are still supported however testing them on Saucelabs is broken and so they were removed from the test matrix.</li>
</ul>
<h3>v3.2.1 2019-03-22</h3>

If adding a **new feature**, the PR's description includes:
- [ ] A convincing reason for adding this feature (to avoid wasting your time, it's best to open a suggestion issue first and wait for approval before working on it)

**Other information:**
Reasons:

- The virtual module is wrapped [here]( LINK which adds [the wrapper](LINK
	  
  ```js
	  (function(exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname) {
	  // Module code actually lives in here
	  });
  ```
	  
  However, `__filename` and `__dirname` are not provided:
  LINK

- When Webpack 5 builds for a Node.js target, it uses the following code. Because `__filename` is `undefined`, `require(""url"").pathToFileURL(__filename)` breaks. Notice this is with both `optimization.splitChunks` and `optimization.runtimeChunk` set to `false`, and there are no chunks -- proven by the `installedChunks` object below.

  ```js
  /******/ 	/* webpack/runtime/require chunk loading */
  /******/ 	(() => {
  /******/ 		__webpack_require__.b = require(""url"").pathToFileURL(__filename);
  /******/ 		
  /******/ 		// object to store loaded chunks
  /******/ 		// ""1"" means ""loaded"", otherwise not loaded yet
  /******/ 		var installedChunks = {
  /******/ 			""main"": 1
  /******/ 		};
  /******/ 		
  /******/ 		// no on chunks loaded
  /******/ 		
  /******/ 		var installChunk = (chunk) => {
  /******/ 			var moreModules = chunk.modules, chunkIds = chunk.ids, runtime = chunk.runtime;
  /******/ 			for(var moduleId in moreModules) {
  /******/ 				if(__webpack_require__.o(moreModules, moduleId)) {
  /******/ 					__webpack_require__.m[moduleId] = moreModules[moduleId];
  /******/ 				}
  /******/ 			}
  /******/ 			if(runtime) runtime(__webpack_require__);
  /******/ 			for(var i = 0; i < chunkIds.length; i++)
  /******/ 				installedChunks[chunkIds[i]] = 1;
  /******/ 		
  /******/ 		};
  /******/ 		
  /******/ 		// require() chunk loading for javascript
  /******/ 		__webpack_require__.f.require = (chunkId, promises) => {
  /******/ 			// ""1"" is the signal for ""already loaded""
  /******/ 			if(!installedChunks[chunkId]) {
  /******/ 				if(true) { // all chunks have JS
  /******/ 					installChunk(require(""./"" + __webpack_require__.u(chunkId)));
  /******/ 				} else installedChunks[chunkId] = 1;
  /******/ 			}
  /******/ 		};
  /******/ 		
  /******/ 		// no external install chunk
  /******/ 		
  /******/ 		// no HMR

getType is called a lot, and it just run the same regexp over and over on the same base types.
A cache increase its own efficiency by more than 80% for basic types.
On a real world application with a lot of components, getType was profiled for 8% of call duration before this patch, and about 0.5% after.
The impact is more limited for smaller applications.

The issue that this PR aims to fix documents the observed performance issue and explains it pretty well.

At this moment in time upgrading to Vue 3 is not currently an option for me, getting some resolution to this issue would be awesome, hence the PR.

The PR aims to maintain compatibility with ES5 based browsers, but where Set is supported then it would favour that.

507,facebook/react,josepharhar,Bypass react event system for custom elements,"

## Summary

This patch makes react reserved synthetic event handlers behave the same as custom event handlers when used on custom elements.

This fixes LINK because react's event system was somehow preventing any `change` events from getting listened to, and there may be issues with other react reserved events that I don't even know about yet.

Not using the react event system is kind of a big change because it will make the reserved events not wrapped in SyntheticEvent and based on the documentation could also change the names of some events, and I'm not entirely sure if it's really the best option yet.

The code I added to make `onClick` listen to `click` instead of `Click` is based on [preact's implementation](LINK

## Summary

In LINK I document an issue we've discovered while using `react-dom/server.browser` in both a web browser and a Workers runtime (like Cloudflare Workers or Shopify Oxygen).

The root of the problem appears to be related to the fact that the reader of a `ReadableStream` can call `pull` whenever it pleases, which triggers `flushCompletedQueues`. This conflicts with Suspense boundaries which enqueue additional calls to `flushCompletedQueues` via `pingTask`.

This problem has not yet surfaced in existing fixtures (`fizz-ssr-browser`) because `await response.blob()` is called, which results in `pull` being called exactly once more after the stream is locked.

This PR adds a new status to `Request` called `FLUSHING` which gets set at the top of `flushCompletedQueues` and returned back to `OPEN` in the `finally` block.

I have no idea if this is the correct solution, but it seems to solve the problem in the test fixture I've provided in this PR.

## How did you test this change?

-->

To replicate this problem, comment out the changes made to `flushCompletedQueues` in this PR and run:

```bash
yarn build react/index,react-dom --type=UMD
open fixtures/fizz-ssr-browser-streaming/index.html
```

This should open a page in your web browser which results in the following:

<img width=""1624"" alt=""Screen Shot 2021-12-08 at 9 47 41 PM"" src=""LINK

You can get a slightly different error if you add an additional Suspense boundary! Uncomment the second boundary in the `fixtures/fizz-ssr-browser-streaming/index.html` file and reload the page:

<img width=""1624"" alt=""Screen Shot 2021-12-08 at 9 52 29 PM"" src=""LINK

To resolve this issue, you can uncomment the changes made in this PR to `flushCompletedQueues` and run this again:

```bash
yarn build react/index,react-dom --type=UMD
open fixtures/fizz-ssr-browser-streaming/index.html
```

Now you should see the streaming resolve fine without competing calls to `flushCompletedQueues` (for a single and for multiple Suspense boundaries):

## Summary

<!--
 Explain the **motivation** for making this change. What existing problem does the pull request solve?
-->

This fixes #22833 by making appending an HTML document instead copy over the attributes of HTML, Head, and Body (preserving the original HTML/Head/Body elements) and then setting the innerHTML of Body/Head.

This stops us from running into `Uncaught DOMException: Failed to execute 'appendChild' on 'Node': Only one element on document allowed` while trying to client render a full page into document.

1. Add-root messages get two new attributes: one specifying whether the root is running in strict mode and another specifying whether the root (really the root's renderer) supports the concept of strict mode.
2. A new backend message type (`TREE_OPERATION_SET_SUBTREE_MODE`). This type specifies a subtree root (id) and a mode (bitmask). For now, the only mode this message deals with is strict mode.

I added a test for the issue being fixed which failed before this change, however I found [an old PR discussion ](LINK that legacy behavior was to only clear `body` but there aren't any tests for this behavior and I don't understand why we'd want this behavior?

This is an alternative proposal, where we just use a few fields as makeshift ""return values"" to avoid allocating. I think I've seen this somewhere in the code.

536,facebook/react,mdanyalkhan,Show warning on invalid value for option,"## Summary
Reference: #11734  
if `value= {Symbol | Function}` for an option, we ensure that it is ignored (with a warning displayed in dev) rather than have an error thrown onto the browser. Note that this is specific to SSR.  

The reason why this occurred is because there was an attempt in converting `value` to a string at line 733, which would then throw if the type of `value` was a `symbol` or `function`. So to prevent this from happening, I re-used the function `shouldRemoveAttributeWithWarning` to firstly determine if the value was a `symbol` or `function` (or any other invalid type) before casting this into a string.

## How did you test this change?
I tested this by setting up a simple react component as shown below, and utilised `ReactDOMServer.renderToString` to render the component and sent this to the client (effectively replicating SSR behaviour). 
```
  export default () => {
    return (
      <>
        <label htmlFor=""letters"">Choose a letter:</label>

        <select>
          <option value={Symbol('test')}>A</option>
          <option value=""B"">B</option>
          <option value=""C"">C</option>
          <option value=""D"">D</option>
        </select>
      </>
    );
  };
```

Behaviour if using Main branch (further debug information that is provided as part of the error message has been omitted):
![image](LINK

Behaviour with my changes:
![image](LINK

Note that I did attempt to write a test (via the file `ReactDOMServerIntegrationSelect-test`) to confirm that the html option object's `value` property is empty if the developer specifies a `symbol` or `function` type. However, although this test would pass for client-side rendered html elements, this does not pass if rendered server side (even though no `value` attribute is explicitly attached to the option element). If rendered server-side and if the option's `value` attribute is queried, it looks like the option element will implicitly return its child text element if its `value` attribute is empty. So going with the markup above as an example, querying the value for the first option element will return ""A"" if rendered server side. This does bring to light some very subtle differences in behaviour both server and client-side that I'm not too sure is worth addressing in this PR.

Here's the test that I wrote below just as an FYI:

```
 itRenders(
    'a select option with no value if the initial value was a symbol type',
    async render => {
      const e = await render(
        <select readOnly={true}>
          <option value={Symbol('test')}>A</option>
        </select>,
        1
      );
      const option = e.options[0];
      expect(option.value).toBe('');
    }

This is a follow-up from LINK - @gaearon suggested that the automated tests from the linked PR could still be useful. I've split the tests out, and converted it to a snapshot test as suggested. 



## How did you test this change?

Tests pass. (or so I hope)

538,facebook/react,rgbkids,fix: SyntaxError: JSON.parse: bad parsing,"## Summary

There was a bug in `packages/react-fetch/src/ReactFetchNode.js`.
It's the usage of `JSON.parse()`.

SyntaxError: JSON.parse: bad parsing
LINK


## How did you test this change?

There was a bug in `packages/react-fetch/src/ReactFetchNode.js`.
It's the usage of `JSON.parse()`.

```
  json() {
    ...
    const json = JSON.parse(buffer.toString());
    ...
  },
```

`JSON.parse()` throws SyntaxError in the following example.

For example:

```
let json = JSON.parse(""""); // => SyntaxError
```

- Documents
LINK

This was discovered when testing the `reactjs/server-components-demo`.

- fix: JSON.parse fails in react-fetch
LINK

I created a test code. When I ran it, it threw a `SyntaxError`.

- packages/react-fetch/src/__tests__/ReactFetchNode-test.js

```
  // @gate experimental || www
  it('handles different paths with json', async () => {
    serverImpl = (req, res) => {
      switch (req.url) {
        case '/banana':
          res.write('banana');
          break;
        case '/mango':
          res.write('mango');
          break;
        case '/orange':
          res.write('orange');
          break;
      }
      res.end();
    };
    const outputs = await waitForSuspense(() => {
      return [
        fetch(serverEndpoint + 'banana').json(),
        fetch(serverEndpoint + 'mango').json(),
        fetch(serverEndpoint + 'orange').json(),
      ];
    });
    expect(outputs).toMatchObject(['banana', 'mango', 'orange']);
  });
```

I used the test code `handles different paths` as a reference.
The URL for fetch is the concatenation of the `serverEndpoint` of the test code and the random string `banana`.

LINK

Since it is not an `Invalid URL`, the status of the response will be as follows.

```
console.log(statusCode >= 200); // => true
console.log(record.status === Resolved); // => true
```

However, the response will not be in json format, because I have specified a random string `banana`.
The body of the response will be a string in which the following conditions are true.

```
console.log(buffer.toString().length === 0); // => true
console.log(buffer.toString() === """"); // => true
```

Command to run the test code: 

```
yarn test --watch packages/react-fetch/src/__tests__/ReactFetchNode-test.js
```

Results: 

```

```

I modified `json()` as follows. I added `catch { }`.
If an Error throws, get it with `text()`.

- packages/react-fetch/src/ReactFetchNode.js

```
  json() {
    if (this._json !== null) {
      return this._json;
    }
    const buffer = readRecordValue(this._bufferRecord);
    try {
      this._json = JSON.parse(buffer.toString());
    } catch (error) {
      return this.text();
    }
    return this._json;
  },
```

Passed the test.

552,facebook/react,jstejada,Ensure react-is version used for resolution for playwright is installed,"## Summary

In #22790, we added a custom yarn resolution for the `react-is` package so that when we ran React Devtools E2E tests using playwright, we wouldn't incorrectly use the top level version of `react-is` in this repo (which would fail because src code hasn't undergone transpilation), and instead use the actual packaged version from npm.

However, we noticed that when trying to run an internal build of devtools we were running into the following error:

![image](LINK

The reason was that the package specified in the `resolutions` wasn't installed at all in the repo for some reason, so yarn couldn't find it.

To fix this, this commit makes it so we always install `react-is` from npm via our `resolutions`, instead of a specific version.

## How did you test this change?

- Locally in `react-devtools-inline`: `yarn test:e2e` works now (tests are running, but they are failing on main currently)
- Internally sync script can correctly build devtools now",1

554,facebook/react,bvaughn,StyleX plug-in for resolving atomic styles to values for props.xstyle,"Adds the concept of ""plugins"" to the inspected element payload. Also adds the first plugin, one that resolves StyleX atomic style names to their values and displays them as a unified style object (rather than a nested array of objects and booleans).

Note the new ""stylex"" panel below the props panel. Source file names are displayed first, in dim color, followed by an ordered set of resolved style values:
<img width=""917"" alt=""Screen Shot 2021-12-07 at 1 21 06 PM"" src=""LINK

A more complex set of styles (from multiple sources) can be seen here:
<img width=""916"" alt=""Screen Shot 2021-12-07 at 1 21 30 PM"" src=""LINK

Compare the new display to the behavior of viewing the `xstyle` prop directly:
<img width=""918"" alt=""Screen Shot 2021-12-07 at 1 21 56 PM"" src=""LINK

For builds with the new feature flag disabled, there is no observable change.

A next step to build on top of this could be to make the style values editable, but change the logic such that editing one directly added an inline style to the item (rather than modifying the stylex class– which may be shared between multiple other components).",4

## Summary

When we server render an empty string from the server the browser does not create a text node for the empty string. This leads to a hydration mismatch. Since #22629 we now throw on mismatches and fallback to client render. This causes empty strings to always lead to client rendering #22784. To fix this we're making the client treat empty strings as null so that there is no mismatch.

## Summary

Since #22629 we now throw on mismatches and fallback to client render. This causes empty strings to always lead to client rendering #22784. This diff adds logic in hydration to insert an empty text node if there isn't one already when processing a fiber for an empty string text node. If we do another pass and see the empty text node again then it should be there already so we use the previously created one.

The odd part was that the `pretty-format` used by Jest (node_modules/pretty-format) does install its own `react-is` from npm (node_modules/pretty-format/node_modules/react-is). But the pretty-format from playwright does not and therefore uses the top-level react-is (node_modules/react-is). However, the top-level react-is is the one checked-in i.e. the uncompiled version.

I used `resolutions` to enforce that `pretty-format` uses `react-is` from npm.

Note that only one test is passing at the moment. But at least they are runnable at the moment.

## Summary

This warning makes it a lot easier to identify where exactly a hydration mismatch occurs. It looks like this:

```
An error occurred during hydration. expected article got DIV. At: [object HTMLDivElement] Inside: [object HTMLDivElement]
```

I opted to log the HTML element object itself rather than stringifying it to make it much easier for developers to identify where exactly the mismatch is. Otherwise it could still be difficult to identify where it is. Open to any other approaches/suggestions.

I removed it and updated `ecmaVersion` from `8` to `9` to keep the number structure. It is equivalent to `2018` [(source)](LINK

### 2. `globals` with boolean values.

From the [documentation](LINK

> To configure global variables inside of a configuration file, set the `globals` configuration property to an object containing keys named for each of the global variables you want to use. For each global variable key, set the corresponding value equal to `""writable""` to allow the variable to be overwritten or `""readonly""` to disallow overwriting. [...]

> 

Currently, all globals are set to `true`. To update them and keep the functionality strictly the same, I could have updated them to `""writeable""`. However, linting works fine with `""readonly""` too, which seems preferable because it produces a stricter test.

582,facebook/react,bvaughn,Add test selectors to experimental build,"I'd like to investigate what it might look like to write DevTools e2e tests using these selectors.

This change adds a new `react-dom/unstable_testing` entry point but I believe its contents will exactly match `react-dom/index` for the _stable_ build. (The _experimental_ build will have the added new selector APIs.) See below on testing/verification of this assumption.

If we think it's important to not even include this file, I can look into that– not sure if our current build script supports this functionality at the moment though.

---

To test the result of this change on the built bundles, I ran:
```sh
yarn build-combined react-dom/testing  --type=NODE
```
Then compared `build/oss-experimental/react-dom` and `build/oss-stable/react-dom`.

The _experimental_ build contains the following exports:
```js
exports.__SECRET_INTERNALS_DO_NOT_USE_OR_YOU_WILL_BE_FIRED = Internals;
exports.createComponentSelector = createComponentSelector;
exports.createHasPseudoClassSelector = createHasPseudoClassSelector;
exports.createPortal = createPortal$1;
exports.createRoleSelector = createRoleSelector;
exports.createRoot = createRoot;
exports.createTestNameSelector = createTestNameSelector;
exports.createTextSelector = createTextSelector;
exports.findAllNodes = findAllNodes;
exports.findBoundingRects = findBoundingRects;
exports.findDOMNode = findDOMNode;
exports.flushSync = flushSync$1;
exports.focusWithin = focusWithin;
exports.getFindAllNodesFailureDescription = getFindAllNodesFailureDescription;
exports.hydrate = hydrate;
exports.hydrateRoot = hydrateRoot;
exports.observeVisibleRects = observeVisibleRects;
exports.render = render;
exports.unmountComponentAtNode = unmountComponentAtNode;
exports.unstable_batchedUpdates = batchedUpdates$1;
exports.unstable_flushControlled = flushControlled;
exports.unstable_renderSubtreeIntoContainer = renderSubtreeIntoContainer;
exports.unstable_runWithPriority = runWithPriority;
exports.version = ReactVersion;
```
And the _stable_ build has the following:
```js
exports.__SECRET_INTERNALS_DO_NOT_USE_OR_YOU_WILL_BE_FIRED = Internals;
exports.createPortal = createPortal$1;
exports.createRoot = createRoot;
exports.findDOMNode = findDOMNode;
exports.flushSync = flushSync$1;
exports.hydrate = hydrate;
exports.hydrateRoot = hydrateRoot;
exports.render = render;
exports.unmountComponentAtNode = unmountComponentAtNode;
exports.unstable_batchedUpdates = batchedUpdates$1;
exports.unstable_renderSubtreeIntoContainer = renderSubtreeIntoContainer;
exports.version = ReactVersion;
```

---

Note to self, after building this...
```sh
yarn build-for-devtools
```

I played around with this a bit in the test shell like so:
```js
// react-devtools-shell/src/app/index.js

import * as Testing from 'react-dom';
window.Testing = Testing;

// In the console

const iframe = document.getElementById('target');
const testBody = iframe.contentWindow.document.body;
const Testing = iframe.contentWindow.Testing;

const firstToDoItem = Testing.findAllNodes(
  testBody,
  [Testing.createTextSelector('First')]
);

## Summary
Detailed discussion here : #22646 
This PR is just a starting point for writing E2E tests for inline package with playwright.

## What does the test do ?
It checks the components(ToDo List) and emulates it in the devtools by clicking and inspecting.
Then it matches the props with component props.

## How did you test this change?
run `yarn test` in `react-devtools-inline` package.

## Quick Demo 👀

Older versions will remain broken because there's not a good way to read the current context value for a location in the tree _after_ render has completed.

## Summary

In doing the micro front-end sub-application encountered the problem of sub-application hot update does not work, I debugged it like this
1. use the online (test environment) main application address
2. proxy the sub-application to be debugged to localhost (localhost domain)

In order to keep the `Shared React Context`, our sub-application is loaded by the main application as a `React component`, because `react-refresh` is loaded only when the sub-application is executed, so the current root is not properly collected in the `mountedRoots`, and eventually the hot update of the application does not work.

## How did you test this change?

When determining `wasMounted`, adjust to
```js
const wasMounted =
            alternate.memoizedState != null &&
            alternate.memoizedState.element != null &&
            mountedRoots.has(root);
```

Logically, there is no breaking change here, and it solves my problem perfectly

Current React Server Component uses webpack 4 when webpack 5 had been out for more than 1 year.
This PR updated the current plugin `packages/react-server-dom-webpack/src/ReactFlightWebpackPlugin.js` to be compatible with the latest webpack 5

The original development was done in LINK and written in typescript. 

I tested it by using the plugin in `server-components-demo` project
- run `npm run start`
- manually tested the application for everything to be the same.
- compare `react-client-manifest.json` build output in webpack 4 & webpack 5 (the content are exactly the same with the exception of vendor files are named differently in webpack 5)
- compare build assets output to be the same

I add AGI CoCoSci to Awesome to fill-in its absence of academic resources on artificial general intelligence and computational cognitive sciences. 

- AGI CoCoSci provides users with following resources:
	- Classic and cutting-edge research papers and books categorized in diverse intelligent phenomena, with direct links and links to *Google Scholar All Versions*, some of which also include links to codes and project websites;
	- Established institutes and researchers on related topics;
	- Eminent scientists and thinkers on related topics with their historical representative books;
	- BibTex templates for composing papers with latex on related topics.

Artificial General Intelligence an emerging inter-discipline field that combines artificial intelligence and computational cognitive sciences as majority, alone with probability and mathematical statistics, formal logic, cognitive and developmental psychology, computational philosophy, cognitive neuroscience, and computational sociology. We are promoting high-level machine intelligence by getting inspirations from the way that human learns and thinks, while obtaining a deeper understanding of human cognition simultaneously. We believe that this kind of reciprocative research is a potential way towards our big picture: building intelligent agents with the capacity to handle human-level tasks such as abstracting, explaining, learning, planning, and making decisions.

611,sindresorhus/awesome,mbrg,Add Low-code,"LINK

This is a list of awesome low-code application development platforms, resources, and tools to help citizen and professional developers dive into the low-code world.
Low-code platforms place more power in the hands of business professionals by letting them build application with minimal to no coding skills requires, mostly through a drag and drop interface. This empowers the business to address their own issues rather than ask for IT's help. It also helps proffesional developers accelarate time-to-market and reduce their maintenance costs. The low-code ecosystem is very large, and this list tries to help people navigate it.

The list helps business users and developers answer the following questions (and many more):

- Which low-code platforms are relevant for my use case?
- Where can I learn about low-code and become a better low-code developer?
- What are some common use-cases for low-code?
- Where can I discuss my low-code challanges and ideas with likeminded colleagues?

We continously expand this list to include platforms, categories, books, learning materials, reference materials, ready-to-use solutions and more. Including this list as part of the awesome list of awesome topics would help share the knowledge about low-code, improve the knowledge base and make it easier for people to learn about it.

Note that we use _awesome-list_ as part of PR validation so there's no need to check for those issues.

We have reviewed there requirements for inclusion, and have made edits sufficient to pass awesome-lint checks. We needed to add a disable flag for our TOC (there was error with no clear direction to resolve), but are willing to work through that if that is determined to be necessary. Generally, we felt the awesome-lint process while difficult improved the quality of our repo. 
Edit*
We are not going to rename our repo to awesome-urban-planning because of the existing of a training where this repo name is used, and there are concerns the name would not be inclusive from our membership. 
We hope that the  mission to create an index of knowledge resources is sufficient for compliance, but we are willing to discuss edits.

661,sindresorhus/awesome,innocenzi,Add Inertia.js,"LINK

This list is related to [Inertia.js](LINK a protocol for making single-page applications without having to design and write an API. Inertia.js requires a back-end and a front-end adapter, but I added it to the ""front-end development"" category because I think it's what fits the most, given the fact that there is no ""web development"" category, and that people use Inertia.js in order to make SPAs.

Type system: strong static typing, nice generics, concepts, and type classes
Performance: matches C and C++, always gives control to the programmer
Portability: compiles to C, C++, and Javascript
Native use of all libraries in target languages (no ABI issues) + really nice FFI
Single (tiny) executable with no deps
Write server/client in the same language and share code between front/back end
Linux, Windows, and Mac
Iterating: Very fast compile speed
Top tier metaprogramming:
Hygienic AST Macros a core part of the language, very flexible syntax
Runs a VM of Nim at compile time giving you most of the language (bar pointers) to generate code or run procedures and store them as const
Eg; async implemented just with macros, doesn't need special language support
Eg; can automate building types and code from file data at compile time

674,sindresorhus/awesome,pgollucci,Add Projen,"LINK

Reviewed: #1794, #1823, #1980

This list provides the projen community a central place for reference patterns and use.

`projen` is actually pretty important, it is used by several MAJOR opensource projects like:
- CDK8s now in the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)
- CDKtf HashiCorp's terraform CDK
- Armkit Community Driven Azure CDK
- Constructs the AWS projects underpinning AWS CDK
- Construct Cataloge the Open Source index of CDK Constructs

There are already over 1,000 GitHub repos using projen and it was featured at CDK Day 2020.
It will be featured again at CDK Day in 2021. This is a global community driven event attracting
thousands.

As projen itself is an NPM module it needs maintenance so this already includes
dependabot, mergify, codecov, codeql, synk to keep it up to date without intervention.

This list, based on p6-projen-project-awesome-list, is self updating too.

All PRs also run npx awesome-lint automatically before allowing merge.

I have gone to great lenghts to automate in code the requests in the pull_request_template.

I am open to anything I missed.

686,sindresorhus/awesome,RayBB,Run `awesome-lint` on new additions,"Note: This PR is a repeat of #1851 since the fork or original fork was deleted. This PR address comments there.


I really appreciate this project and wanted to try to give back so it's a little easier for everyone involved.
To that end, I created this PR to **automatically lint new lists** when someone opens a PR to add them.

## Benefits
  - It will save time of maintainers by allowing them to look at the error message first
  - It will provide immediate feedback to people who make a PR
  - It helps people having trouble installing `awesome-lint`
  - It is free

## Risks
  - As far as I know, there is no risk to users or maintainers.

## What it does
- PR will lint **NEW** lists that are requesting to be added.
- PR will **NOT** lint [this](LINK repo itself. If that functionality is desired it can happen in a separate PR (see LINK
- PR will **NOT** lint the current lists in the readme.

## How it does it
This PR creates a GitHub action that will do the following every time a new commit is pushed to an open PR:
1. Find the URL that is being added using `git diff`
2. Clone that repo
3. Run `awesome-lint`on that repo.

The above 3 steps will **ONLY** run if `readme.md` is changed.
If readme is changed and no new URL is detected in the readme it will NOT fail with a helpful error message.
Error can be ignored if it is a cosmetic PR

[Here](LINK are examples of failing commits.

## Final notes

""Squash and Merge"" this PR or let me know and I will squash it manually.

Feel free to edit this any way you see fit or ask me to make the edits. 👍
If there are any questions on how this works drop them here and I'll try my best to answer.

Again, thanks so much for all the hard work the maintainers put into this repo! 👏 ",14

- Does not contain items that are unmaintained, has archived repo, deprecated, or missing docs. If you really need to include such items, they should be in a separate Markdown file.
- Includes a project logo/illustration whenever possible.
	- Either centered, fullwidth, or placed at the top-right of the readme. [(Example)](LINK
	- The image should link to the project website or any relevant website.
	- **The image should be high-DPI.** Set it to maximum half the width of the original image.
- Entries have a description, unless the title is descriptive enough by itself. It rarely is though.
- Includes the [Awesome badge](awesome.md#awesome-badge).
	- Should be placed on the right side of the readme heading.
		- Can be placed centered if the list has a centered graphics header.
	- Should link back to this list.
- Has a Table of Contents section.
	- Should be named `Contents`, not `Table of Contents`.
	- Should be the first section in the list.
	- Should only have one level of [nested lists](LINK preferably none.
	- Must not feature `Contributing` or `Footnotes` sections.
- Has an appropriate license.
	- **We strongly recommend the [CC0 license](LINK but any [Creative Commons license](LINK will work.**
		- Tip: You can quickly add it to your repo by going to this URL: `LINK (replace `<user>` and `<repo>` accordingly).
	- A code license like MIT, BSD, Apache, GPL, etc, is not acceptable. Neither are WTFPL and [Unlicense](LINK
	- Place a file named `license` or `LICENSE` in the repo root with the license text.
	- **Do not** add the license name, text, or a `Licence` section to the readme. GitHub already shows the license name and link to the full text at the top of the repo.
	- To verify that you've read all the guidelines, please comment on your pull request with just the word `unicorn`.
- Has [contribution guidelines](awesome.md#include-contribution-guidelines).
	- The file should be named `contributing.md`. Casing is up to you.
	- It can optionally be linked from the readme in a dedicated section titled `Contributing`, positioned at the top or bottom of the main content.
	- The section should not appear in the Table of Contents.
- All non-important but necessary content (like extra copyright notices, hyperlinks to sources, pointers to expansive content, etc) should be grouped in a `Footnotes` section at the bottom of the readme. The section should not be present in the Table of Contents.
- Has consistent formatting and proper spelling/grammar.
	- The link and description are separated by a dash. <br>Example: `- [AVA](…) - JavaScript test runner.`
	- The description starts with an uppercase character and ends with a period.
	- Consistent and correct naming. For example, `Node.js`, not `NodeJS` or `node.js`.
- Doesn't use [hard-wrapping](LINK
- Doesn't include a Travis badge.<br>You can still use Travis for list linting, but the badge has no value in the readme.
- Doesn't include an `Inspired by awesome-foo` or `Inspired by the Awesome project` kinda link at the top of the readme. The Awesome badge is enough.

- Line 9: ""dar -lhes"" instead of ""dar a eles"" (enclisis);
- Line 29: changed to ""caso você esteja"" because it's subjunctive, a possibility;
- Line 29: changed ""depois"" to ""em seguida"" because the way it was gave the idea of anytime/later, not subsequence;

816,tensorflow/tensorflow,Kh4L,[TF-TRT] Add Layout + ConstFold optimization on the TRT engine op,"### Motivation
The introduction of Tensor Cores in recent GPU architectures (and the subsequent changes in cuDNN) made `NHWC` the preferred layout for convolutions in TF.

However, the TensorRT API requires the input for convolution to be in `NCHW`. To satisfy this requirement, TF-TRT was inserting transpose ops around convolutions when necessary.

This PR adds a layout optimization pass with a target layout of `NCHW`, which ensures that most of Conv kernels will be in TRT compatible layout. Additionally, the layout optimization pass can eliminate redundant layout transpose operations. This results in a simpler TRT network with a larger potential for optimization.

### Description
TF-TRT now accomplishes it by running both a grapplers's `GenericLayoutOptimizer` followed by a ConstantFolding optimizers  in the `ConvertGraphDefToEngine`, applying them on a segment level.

The LayoutOptimizer ensures that the number of transposition is optimal. This optimization is described in slides 18-21 of [TensorFlow Graph Optimizations presentation ](LINK

This PR also modifies the `GenericLayoutOptimizer` to enforce a specific layout is set as layout target, through a ctor parameter.",1

The Eigen commit changes the visibility of the `Packet` type ( `Packet4h2`) for the `Eigen::half` datatype. Prior to the commit, `Packet` type is defined as `Packet4h2` during both the `host` and `device` compile phases of hipcc/nvcc. After the commit the `Packet` type is defined as `Eigen::half` (size == 2) in the `host` compile phase, and as `Packet4h2` (size == 8) in the device compile phase.

`struct AvgPoolMeanReducer` has a member of type `Packet`(LINK and hence its size will be different during the `host` compile phase and `device` compile phase. It also seems that the implementation of the `average pooling` op ( LINK ) will result in a `struct AvgPoolMeanReducer` argument being passed across the `host` / `device` compile boundary (atleast for `hipcc`) and size mismatch between the two, leads to the subsequent segfault.

The fix here is to ensure the `Packet` has the same definitition for both the `host` and `device` compile phases. However changing the type `packetCount_` to `int` unconditionally leads to compile errors, because during the non-gpu / gcc compiles the code within the `!defined(__HIPCC__)` block gets activated, and hence the changes in this commit are guarded by `defined(__HIPCC__)`. Using `int` for `packetCount_` is ok because `PacketAcces`s is already set to `false` within (a different) `defined(__HIPCC__)` block.

Previously TensorFlow required a `typing-extensions` version in the `3.7.x` series. However, the newer `3.10.x` series is fully backwards-compatible with the `3.7.x` series (and there are no `3.8.x` or `3.9.x` series). Therefore, these changes allow `typing-extensions` to be installed using either the `3.7.x` or `3.10.x` series.

In order to ensure that any future backwards-incompatible changes in the `typing-extensions` package don't cause issues, TensorFlow's dependency on `typing-extensions` does not allow versions from the `3.11.x` series or beyond (`< 3.11`).",1

853,tensorflow/tensorflow,tfeher,TF:TRT Fix shape value collection,"TRT has a special API to specify shape value inputs, therefore TF-TRT uses a boolean mask (`is_shape_value_`) that defines which input tensors correspond to shape inputs. 

Whether a tensor is a shape tensor (from TRT's point of view) can be only determined once the TRT network is constructed (or equivalently, the TRT engine is loaded). If the network construction (or engine loading during deserialization) fails, then the input mask might not be correctly initialized, which can lead to an error in the subsequent memory copy. This PR fixes the initialization of the `is_shape_value_` mask to avoid this error.

856,tensorflow/tensorflow,Nyrio,[TF-TRT] Add Grappler optimizers to converter,"cc @bixia1 @tfeher @DEKHTIARJonathan

This mitigates one of the problems seen in LINK and makes that BERT Large model (and others) convert successfully.

- In the previous set of optimizers, `constfold` was duplicating constants unnecessarily due to some control dependencies. `dependency` and `common_subgraph_elimination` do a great job at removing this duplication.
- I also noticed that having a `constfold` before _and_ after `layout` was unnecessary, and in all the models I've tested, equivalent to just having the second one.

I haven't measured any significant performance impact but the size of converted transformer models tends to be reduced by 50% with this change.

_Note: I had to change the tests slightly because the dependency optimizer removes the `ReadVariableOp` and keeps a constant `v1` whereas constant folding alone optimizes `ReadVariableOp` to a constant with the value of `v1`. This  also depends on the order of the Grappler passes.",2

  - After calibration, each `TRTEngineOp` has its calibration table saved to its own asset file
- Removes the previous code for saving and loading of calibration tables via attributes
- Currently, calibration tables are saved using attributes which means that the calibration tables count towards the 2GB ProtoBuf size limit. By migrating to asset files, the tables no longer count towards the 2GB limit and can be as large as necessary.

867,tensorflow/tensorflow,Nyrio,[TF-TRT] Provide a way to use different Grappler optimizers for the function library than the main graph,"This is a POC that probably needs some refining. During TF-TRT conversion, we need to turn on different optimizers during optimization of the main graph and `TRTEngine` functions. Since other functions are inlined, it is effectively equivalent to using different optimizers for the function library.

### How it works

- Add fields to `RewriterConfig` to specify an alternate list of optimizers and custom optimizers, along with a boolean to toggle the use of these alternate lists. The default behavior doesn't change (i.e same optimizers for the main graph and function library)
- Add an optional parameter to `MetaOptimizer::OptimizeGraph()` and helper functions to know whether the main graph or function library is being optimized, and set this parameter when optimizing the function library in `MetaOptimizer::OptimizeConsumeItem()`.
- When optimizing the function library, get the optimizer list from these new fields if the boolean is true.

A few tries confirmed me that relying on `border-width` as in v4 doesn't imply any side effect, even when using the (deprecated) `size` attribute.

I don't see any reason to stick with `height` then, so ditching this to make our new `hr` closer to v4.

Contrary to what we said in #34574, we can keep the opacity feature this way. With my current proposal, customizing `hr` could be done using `.text-*` for color and `.border-*` for sizing. I'd stick to `currentColor` for color since it allows inheritance: relying on `border-color` would require us to define a value (as it was done in v4) but I think it's more valuable to inherit from text color, isn't it?

927,twbs/bootstrap,FluffyPorkBuns,Made menubar with nested dropdowns keyboard accessible based on W3's menubar design pattern,"Made it so a menubar with nested dropdowns will be keyboard accessible according to W3's menubar design pattern: LINK

- Top-level dropdowns can be navigated through with the left and right arrows or tab keys.
- Top-level dropdowns are opened with spacebar, down arrow, or enter key. First item in dropdown is selected automatically.
- Dropdowns can be navigated with up and down arrows or tab key and selection wraps from beginning to end / end to beginning.
- Sub-dropdowns can be opened with right arrow, spacebar, or enter key. First item in sub-dropdown is selected automatically.
- Dropdowns and sub-dropdowns can be closed with the left arrow or escape key. Only the currently open dropdown or sub-dropdown will close (will not bubble up to all parents and close everything). The item that opened that dropdown is selected automatically.
- Dropdown and sub-dropdown links can be opened with spacebar or enter key and closes entire menubar.
- Only one dropdown can be open at a time in a menubar.
- Fixed a bug where the spacebar didn't open dropdown items (dropdown.js line 39).

I'm guessing my changes may not fit the existing code gracefully (this was created for a specific menubar for a project and I'm not that familiar with this codebase) but I'm interested in hearing what others think about adding these accessibility features to the existing dropdown code.",7

949,twbs/bootstrap,mdo,Convert pagination component to CSS variables,"This PR represents a potential shift in how we're using CSS variables for our components. In previous cases like #34600, I've been creating new CSS variables for each state-property pairing (e.g., `--bs-btn-color`, `--bs-btn-hover-color`, and `--bs-btn-active-color`). This matches our Sass-based customization of variables for almost every property and state, but it does create bloat in the component base class.

In contrast, this PR only sets the essential variables on the base class and uses CSS variable reassignment as needed to modify those properties for each state with their Sass variables. For example, `--bs-pagination-color` is set on `.pagination` and then overridden on `.page-link:hover` using the same `--bs-pagination-color` variable with a new value.

I think this approach makes more sense and can steer us toward more CSS variable re-use (e.g., `--bs-pagination-bg: var(--bs-body-bg)`), steering us away from too much Sass variable re-use that led to complicated customization issues.

---

## Context

Tried it first in [this PR in my forked version of Bootstrap](LINK among other things — All check have passed.
There are still several TODO topics to tackle in LINK
The target of this PR would be `main-xmr-pa11y-ci`.

I chose here to focus on having a green pa11y-ci job by hiding all elements reported as issues; it would help us to track the new issues that will be merged into `main` while trying to fix the current ones.
Indeed, `pa11y-ci` is a bit unstable at the moment and it becomes easier to check regression if you know that the job can be green (everything is OK) instead of having to analyze the red one that can be a regression or a crash...

I was thinking of the following process:

## Fix existing issues
1. **Done here** Hide all the errors reported by pa11y-ci to have a green job.
2. For each `hideElements` rule, analyze it, define if it is a real issue and fill the table below with the analysis in the last column.
3. If the issue can be fixed, open a PR and write its reference in the table below.
4. When the issue is fixed / merged, remove the `hideElements` rule.

## Handle new issues
After each rebase of the `main-xmr-pa11y-ci`, the pa11y-ci job would be executed by GitHub CI. If we observe new issues in the artifact: we should write a new `hideElements` rule and add a new line in the table below.

## Pa11y issues tracker

Total without any `hideElements`: **568 errors**

**Legend**
* :stop_button: Analysis must be done
* :hourglass: Work In Progress — A PR is probably being reviewed
* :white_check_mark: Analysis done — Keep the `hideElements` rule
* :heavy_check_mark: Analysis done — Removed the `hideElements` rule

But I made the calculation and the result must be:

Because we call to `changeObj( 3, 11 );` and:
```
	obj.a = a * 2;

@getify, It is really awesome practice samples!
Despite the fact, that I have been writing JS-code for quite a long term, It took me a lot of time to solve them without tips 😅
They make me think for more elegant solutions!

I carefully checked my solution with yours by examining your source code and came across a few code style shortcomings
Which, in my opinion, should be fixed to improve code readability


1. _Suggested solution for ""Comparisons"" (Pillar 3) practice_
The simpler case `typeof meetingStartHour != ""string"" || (...)` should be handled first to avoid over-nesting
Makes sense?

2. _Suggested solution for ""Closure"" (Pillar 1) practice_
Statement `else` seems like just redundant as for me

I apologize in advance for my excessive pedantry in the scope of code style

1071,getify/You-Dont-Know-JS,mingrn97,New features: Add gitbook feature( Read IT with gitbook ),"## Note

We didn't make any changes, Just a few more files (related to gitbook).

In order to be able to read it like a book, easier to read.

Now the reader just needs to clone the repository for download, and simply run a command in the repository to open the book in the browser.
There is a catalog with instructions, and you can also customize the gitbook plug-in, customized exquisite books.

I think everyone needs better reading habits.


## Change

Add Some file:

- `SUMMARY.md` Gitbook Summary
- `book.json` Gitbook Config(plugin)
- `styles/` gitbook style(css file)

## Sample

1098,getify/You-Dont-Know-JS,pmzi,2nd ed,"1. In the **Operators `||` and `&&`** section, there is a sentence that says:
```
If the test is `false`, the `&&` expression results in the value of the *first operand* (`a` or `c`)
```
For example:
```javascript
console.log(true && '')
```
It will result in the second operand.

2. In the **Abstract Relational Comparison section** you said:
```
The algorithm first calls `ToPrimitive` coercion on both values, and if the return result of either call is not a `string`, then both values are coerced to `number` values using the `ToNumber` operation rules, and compared numerically
```
Which its example is wrong because they have been compared alphabetically:
```javascript
[42] < [""43""]
```
Because `[42]` will be ""42"" and after that ""42"" will be compared to ""43"".
As I explained:
```javascript
[42] < [""043""] // false

1411,ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh,NJAldwin,feat(updater): show command to update when update skipped,"It's great that oh-my-zsh supports a ""reminder"" mode for updating.  I personally prefer the (default) prompting behavior.  However, I occasionally inadvertently dismiss it (usually as part of a ""new tab -> start typing first command"" workflow).  When I do so, I usually want to do the update as soon as possible afterwards.  I have a terrible memory, so it's a nice QOL change to emit the command to manually update, so that I can know what to run right away to trigger the update (rather than waiting for the next time I open a new shell).  This is kind of the best of both worlds of the prompt + reminder behavior.

## Changes:

- in lib/termsupport.zsh's title function: Use a parameter substitution to avoid erroring if INSIDE_EMACS is not set

## Other comments:

After updating ohmyzsh this morning, I was getting the following error:

```
title:4: INSIDE_EMACS: parameter not set                                        
zsh: vcs_info_msg_0_: parameter not set

```

where the final `~` is the start of my prompt, but not the whole thing. I tracked the `title:4` error to this `-n ""$INSIDE_EMACS""` condition and have changed it to `-n ""${INSIDE_EMACS:-}""`. The problem appears to have been introduced in a263cdac9:

If I revert the title function to what it was previously, I no longer get the error. It sounds like there's some important reasons for making that change, though, so I've opted for a parameter substitution instead of changing setopt.",1

1419,ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh,deb0ch,Add plugin for ExpressVPN,"ExpressVPN comes with a completion script for Bash, but none for Zsh. Fortunately, I was able to make it work for both shells pretty easily with only a small modification (see diff below).

This code is not publicly hosted by ExpressVPN, so I figured that here would be a place that makes sense to publish it.

I also submitted the fix via ExpressVPN's support, although I do not know how much faith I should have that it will make it into their codebase someday.

This fix makes the autocompletion script also work on zsh without changing how it works for Bash. The expression ""${COMP_WORDS[@]:2:$COMP_CWORD-2}"" does not behave the
same on Bash and Zsh when the command has only zero or one arguments,
e.g. typing ""expressvpn conne<TAB>"" or ""expressvpn <TAB>"" would print
the error ""autocomplete:8: substring expression: 1 < 2"". This fixes it
by handling the case of the short command separately in a simpler way
and handling the rest of the cases the same way as before.

With this fix, zsh users just have to use the command ""source
/usr/share/bash-completion/completions/expressvpn"" to get the same
auto-completion as bash users.

File : /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/expressvpn

Diff to the original file (using the `diff` command) :

```diff
9a10,12
>         opts=$( ${COMP_WORDS[0]} ""$cmd"" ""${COMP_WORDS[@]:2:$COMP_CWORD-2}"" --generate-bash-completion )
>     else
>         opts=$( ${COMP_WORDS[0]} --generate-bash-completion )
11d13
<     opts=$( ${COMP_WORDS[0]} ""$cmd"" ""${COMP_WORDS[@]:2:$COMP_CWORD-2}"" --generate-bash-completion )
```
**NB:** bash is regularly referenced throughout the file, it is on purpose as I wanted to keep the diff to the original file to a minimum.

## Description

[Toolbox](LINK is a tool for containerized command line environments on Linux. It is shipped for example with Fedora Silverblue. Since toolbox should be used for isolated developer enviroments similiar to virtualenv but with containers, I wrote this plugin to ease the use of toolbox.

The plugin acts in similar fashin to the virtualenvwrapper plugin. If a git directory is found it will enter the default toolbox, or it will read a container name from a `.toolbox` file. If the git directory is exited, the toolbox is also exited. This behavior can be customized with env variables.

Additionally, some convenient aliases are set.

All of this is also documented in the README.",1

Having upgraded to an Apple Silicon-based Mac, I was completely stumped as to why I couldn’t get the autoloading feature to work. Oh My Zsh was working. NVM was working, it didn’t make sense.

> or lines, optionally followed by ‘f’ which has the same meaning

- Replaced the applescript to get the pid of the frontmost app instead of the window id of the active window.

## Other comments:

On recent macOS versions, getting the window id of the active window of the frontmost app using `osascript` and `tell` requires granting permission for controlling said app. This means that if `bgnotify` is active and one puts the terminal in the background, after the terminal process completes it will spawn a permission request window relating to the app currently in the foreground. Obviously this gets annoying really quickly as each new foreground app has to be approved separately. Getting the pid of the frontmost app only requires this permission to be granted once, for the ""System Events"" app.

As I said in #10087, I think that having two plugins for `rustup` and `cargo` instead of having just one is a bit redundant, because generating `cargo` completions needs `rustup`.
I merged both in `cargo`, which is much more daily used by users.

It is just an idea, but I think that would be very interesting to merge it on master!

could hang and wait until `diff` completely scans the current directory.

guaranteed and can be processed rather quickly.

1492,ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh,makusu2,feat(git): add `gupom` alias,"Alias `gupom` to `git pull --rebase origin $(git_main_branch)`.
It is a very common practice for me to rebase off latest remote origin/main once I am finished with a PR, so that the commit history is clean.

## Changes:

- Alias `gupom` to `git pull --rebase origin $(git_main_branch)`
- Update README to reflect the new alias

## Other comments:

*Note in this section that I am using `master`/`main`/`$(git_main_branch)` interchangibly in some places, as the PR I am referencing was created before using `git_main_branch` was common practice.*

Also see @hikaru-shindo's PR LINK which introduces `alias grbom='git rebase origin/master'`.
This is a good suggestion, but it does not cover the full scope of my desires, mainly because it rebases off local origin/master (the version last fetched), not remote origin/master.
I could achieve similar behavior with `gfa && grbom`, but I feel that rebasing off the latest remote master is a common enough practice that a convenient single alias is justified.

1512,flutter/flutter,stereotype441,Respect `--dart-sdk` parameter when running analyze.dart tests.,"The `--dart-sdk` parameter is passed in when invoking this script from
the Dart team's `flutter-analyze` bot, which is intended to provide an
early warning if a commit to the Dart SDK would cause problems with
the Dart SDK roll into Flutter (see
LINK
This change ensures that when `analyze.dart` is run by that bot, and
it invokes `dart` or `pub`, it uses the version of Dart that's under
test, rather than the version of Dart that's been rolled into Flutter
sources.

This change should allow us to simplify the Dart repository's
`analyze_flutter_flutter.sh` script, which we believe will
eliminate the flakiness we're currently seeing with the
`flutter-analyze` bot.

1517,flutter/flutter,mohammadtaherri,Fixes ‍‍`RenderTransform‍`'s `paint` method when `filterQuality` is not null.,"The issue that this **PR** fixes it : 
This **PR** fixes **_#95091 _** (Transform widget is rendered incorrectly if a FilterQuality is set #95091).

**Description:** 
This **PR** changes the behaviour of   `RenderTransform`'s paint method  when `RenderTransform` has a non-null `filterQuality`.
 
The following code describes the `paint` method after change:
```
@override
  void paint(PaintingContext context, Offset offset) {
    if (child != null) {
      final Matrix4 transform = _effectiveTransform!;
      if (filterQuality == null) {
        final Offset? childOffset = MatrixUtils.getAsTranslation(transform);
        if (childOffset == null) {
          layer = context.pushTransform(
            needsCompositing,
            offset,
            transform,
            super.paint,
            oldLayer: layer is TransformLayer ? layer as TransformLayer? : null,
          );
        } else {
          super.paint(context, offset + childOffset);
          layer = null;
        }
      } else {
        final Matrix4 effectiveFilterTransform =
            Matrix4.translationValues(offset.dx, offset.dy, 0.0)
              ..multiply(transform)
              ..translate(-offset.dx, -offset.dy);

        final ui.ImageFilter filter = ui.ImageFilter.matrix(
          effectiveFilterTransform.storage,
          filterQuality: filterQuality!,
        );
        if (layer is ImageFilterLayer) {
          final ImageFilterLayer filterLayer = layer! as ImageFilterLayer;
          filterLayer.imageFilter = filter;
        } else {
          layer = ImageFilterLayer(imageFilter: filter);
        }
        context.pushLayer(layer!, super.paint, offset);
      }
    }
  }
```

If `filterQuality` parameter is not set, `RenderTransform`'s paint method uses the `pushTransform` and passes the `offset` that is passed to it to `pushTransform`.

The following code describes the `RenderTransfrom`'s `paint` method when `filterQuality` is null.
```
 if (filterQuality == null) {
        final Offset? childOffset = MatrixUtils.getAsTranslation(transform);
        if (childOffset == null) {
          layer = context.pushTransform(
            needsCompositing,
            offset,
            transform,
            super.paint,
            oldLayer: layer is TransformLayer ? layer as TransformLayer? : null,
          );
        } else {
          super.paint(context, offset + childOffset);
          layer = null;
        }
      }
```

`pushTransform` creates an `effectiveTransform` and it applies `offset` parameter.then `effectiveTransform` that is included the `offset` is passed to the `pushLayer` or canvas.

```
  TransformLayer? pushTransform(bool needsCompositing, Offset offset,
      Matrix4 transform, PaintingContextCallback painter,
      {TransformLayer? oldLayer}) {
    final Matrix4 effectiveTransform =
        Matrix4.translationValues(offset.dx, offset.dy, 0.0)
          ..multiply(transform)
          ..translate(-offset.dx, -offset.dy);
    if (needsCompositing) {
      final TransformLayer layer = oldLayer ?? TransformLayer();
      layer.transform = effectiveTransform;
      pushLayer(
        layer,
        painter,
        offset,
        childPaintBounds: MatrixUtils.inverseTransformRect(
            effectiveTransform, estimatedBounds),
      );
      return layer;
    } else {
      canvas
        ..save()
        ..transform(effectiveTransform.storage);
      painter(this, offset);
      canvas.restore();
      return null;
    }
  }
```

But if `filterQuality` is set, `RenderTransform`'s paint method uses the `ImageFilterLayer`, but in this case `offset` is not applied.
The following code describes the `RenderTransfrom`'s `paint` method when `filterQuality` is not null.

```
else {
        final ui.ImageFilter filter = ui.ImageFilter.matrix(
          transformstorage,
          filterQuality: filterQuality!,
        );
        if (layer is ImageFilterLayer) {
          final ImageFilterLayer filterLayer = layer! as ImageFilterLayer;
          filterLayer.imageFilter = filter;
        } else {
          layer = ImageFilterLayer(imageFilter: filter);
        }
        context.pushLayer(layer!, super.paint, offset);
      }
```

Therefore I changed the behaviour of `paint` method when `filterQuality` is set.
I defined a new `effectiveFilterTransform` variable and I applied `offset` to it like `pushTransform` method.

```
else {
        final Matrix4 effectiveFilterTransform =
            Matrix4.translationValues(offset.dx, offset.dy, 0.0)
              ..multiply(transform)
              ..translate(-offset.dx, -offset.dy);

        final ui.ImageFilter filter = ui.ImageFilter.matrix(
          effectiveFilterTransform.storage,
          filterQuality: filterQuality!,
        );
        if (layer is ImageFilterLayer) {
          final ImageFilterLayer filterLayer = layer! as ImageFilterLayer;
          filterLayer.imageFilter = filter;
        } else {
          layer = ImageFilterLayer(imageFilter: filter);
        }
        context.pushLayer(layer!, super.paint, offset);
      }
```

Before this change, if we were running this simple code (without  `filterQuality`):

```
main() {
  runApp(const MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return const MaterialApp(
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  const HomePage({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
        body: Center(
      child: Transform(
        // filterQuality: FilterQuality.medium,
        alignment: Alignment.center,
        transformHitTests: true,
        transform: Matrix4.diagonal3Values(2, 2, 0)..rotateZ(pi / 4),
        child: ConstrainedBox(
          constraints: BoxConstraints.tight(
            const Size(50, 75),
          ),
          child: const ColoredBox(
            color: Colors.orange,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    ));
  }
}
```

result :

![Screenshot from 2021-12-11 17-44-46](LINK

It is correct.
But if we set a `filterQuality` to it.

```
main() {
  runApp(const MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return const MaterialApp(
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  const HomePage({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
        body: Center(
      child: Transform(
        filterQuality: FilterQuality.medium,
        alignment: Alignment.center,
        transformHitTests: true,
        transform: Matrix4.diagonal3Values(2, 2, 0)..rotateZ(pi / 4),
        child: ConstrainedBox(
          constraints: BoxConstraints.tight(
            const Size(50, 75),
          ),
          child: const ColoredBox(
            color: Colors.orange,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    ));
  }
}
```

The result will be buggy : 

![Screenshot from 2021-12-11 17-46-38](LINK

But after this issue is fixed : 


```
final Matrix4 effectiveFilterTransform =
            Matrix4.translationValues(offset.dx, offset.dy, 0.0)
              ..multiply(transform)
              ..translate(-offset.dx, -offset.dy);

        final ui.ImageFilter filter = ui.ImageFilter.matrix(
          effectiveFilterTransform.storage,
          filterQuality: filterQuality!,
        );
```

The result will be correct.

1537,flutter/flutter,mohammadtaherri,Fix render-transform's paint method when filter-quality is not null,"This **PR** fixes **_#95091 issue_** (Transform with filterQuality #95091)
This **PR** changes the behaviour of paint's method in `RenderTransform`  when `RenderTransform` have a `filterQuality` to apply.

![Screenshot from 2021-12-11 17-30-59](LINK

If `filterQuality` parameter is not set, `RenderTransform` paint's method uses the `pushTransform` and passes the `offset` that is passed to it to `pushTransform`.
![Screenshot from 2021-12-11 17-31-09](LINK

`pushTransform` creates an `effectiveTransform` and it applies `offset` parameter.then `effectiveTransform` that is included the `offset` is passed to the `pushLayer` or canvas.

![Screenshot from 2021-12-11 17-32-41](LINK
![Screenshot from 2021-12-11 17-33-12](LINK

But if `filterQuality` is set, `RenderTransform` paint's method uses the `ImageFilterLayer`, but in this case `offset` is not applied.
![Screenshot from 2021-12-11 17-34-17](LINK
Therefore I changed the behaviour of paint's method when `filterQuality` is set and it uses the `ImageFilterLayer`.
I define a new `effectiveFilterTransform` variable and I applied `offset` to it like `pushTransform` method.
![Screenshot from 2021-12-11 17-39-14](LINK

Before this changing, if we run this simple code (without set a `filterQuality`)...
![Screenshot from 2021-12-11 17-42-40](LINK
This will be the result.
![Screenshot from 2021-12-11 17-44-46](LINK
It is correct.
But if we set a `filterQuality` to it.
![Screenshot from 2021-12-11 17-46-16](LINK
The result will be buggy :

But after changing code...

1550,flutter/flutter,gspencergoog,Make `FocusNode.traversalChildren` not be affected by parent's `canRequestFocus`,"## Description

In this [Discord conversation](LINK it was pointed out that the docs and the behavior of `FocusNode.traversalChildren` were out of sync. This PR brings them into sync. This was a case of not having test coverage for a function that we don't actually call anymore in the framework.

I also optimized the call to `FocusNode.traversalDescendants` to just return an empty `Iterable` if `descendantsAreFocusable` is false.

## Tests
 - Updated/added tests for `traversalChildren` for both `FocusNode` and `FocusScopeNode`.",1

1552,flutter/flutter,christopherfujino,[flutter_tools] Refactor checkVersionFreshness,"This refactor does not modify any behavior. It is merely a re-organization of the code with added documentation, because the previous state of the code was significantly difficult to understand.

This should make it easier to address LINK",7
1553,flutter/flutter,Piinks,Initialize the Skia client more efficiently,"Might fix LINK
Also tracked in LINK

This moves the call to initialize into the compare method of the Flutter[Pre/Post]SubmitFileComparators. Calling it in the constructor means we might be initializing when there are no image tests being executed.

It also adds a flag to keep track of whether or not an instance of the skia client has been initialized, so we can just skip it in that case too.

Also tidied up a bit while I was at it.

1557,flutter/flutter,dnfield,Ban sync*/async* from user facing code,"This does not make a big difference for compressed APK size, but it saves a few dozen kilobytes on the snapshot size. This is more visible in a smaller app like `hello_world` than a larger one like `flutter_gallery`, since it is a fixed cost savings.

One of the biggest individual savings is on `PointerConverter`, which goes from ~7kb down to ~3.6kb in the snapshot. 

None of the iterables I've changed are actually lazily iterated. I suspect many of them were written before the spread operator and `if/for` building of lists was a feature, and some of them were probably cargo culted from others.

Many of these were allowed to remain becuase they were in exception handling cases or debug only code, where performance wasn't seen as critical. However, the exception handling code does end up bloating the size of the release snapshots, and while a few KB isn't much in a multi-megabyte file it's one area we can try to trim down a bit for memory savings.

While looking at this, I noticed `DebugCreator` was getting retained in release snapshots, so I added logic/testing to verify it is not anymore (particularly since any PR I did to fix that would end up merge conflicting with this one).

I've added two ignores for functions that were _explicitly_ documented as returning lazy iterables on public API.

I've also exempted test code and code in dev/*.

I've added a TODO for the license stuff, since that would really just benefit from the new lightweight isolate API and will probably be easier to review in a separate PR.

On `hello_world` for arm64, this brings the `package:flutter` in app.so from 497kb to 487kb uncompressed. ",10

This fixes various problems with some API examples. There were several places where people had used `{@tool sample}` when they meant `{@tool dartpad}`, and some issues with still using templates, which shouldn't be used except on Engine code at this point (and soon not there either).

## Related Issues
 - Fixes #94978

## Tests
 - Added tests for the two examples I extracted.",1

Currently, when all frames are within the frame budget, `indexWhere` returns `-1` and we end up with `data.length - (-1)` instead of the expected `0`. This PR fixes this bug.

In order to solve the cross-domain problem to share cookie, a launch url that match the same-origin policy should be used when the browser is first opened, so we need to support configure a custom launch url for flutter web.

Here's a quick summary of the changes:

* allow cancellation of RefreshIndicator with `position.correctBy`
* `_kDragContainerExtentPercentage` 0.25 -> 0.5
* mitigate an extra friction on iOS which became obvious from changing `_kDragContainerExtentPercentage`
* declare a clear `_kArmedThreshold`
* various curves to try to match Android
* keep last value before going indeterminate

1576,flutter/flutter,dkwingsmt,Delete and Backspace shortcuts accept optional Shift modifier,"This PR changes Delete and Backspace related shortcuts in editable text so that they accept an optional shift modifier. For example, both `backspace` and `shift + backspace` now works as deleting backwards, while previously only `backspace` works.

To implement this, `SingleActivator` is changed so that all 4 modifier fields now have type `bool?` instead of `bool`. The extra ""null"" option means that this modifier is not checked. The default argument is still ""false"".

Tests are also added to check `backspace` and `shift + backspace` works in EditableText.

1578,flutter/flutter,LongCatIsLooong,Use [Intent]s to send text input plugin commands to text fields,"Fixes #30725 #85328

- Introduces a new `TextInputConnection` type that dispatches text input plugin commands in the form of `Intent`s to Flutter text fields, as an alternative to the current `TextInputClient` approach. This allows text input plugin authors to add new capabilities to Flutter text fields without having to update a static interface (currently all capabilities have to be added to the `TextInputClient` interface and it's always a breaking change to add a new one). See LINK
- Removes framework-defined macOS shortcuts. The macOS text input plugin will let the system handle shortcuts/keybindings, and convert selector names retrieved in `doCommandBySelector:` to framework intents, and send the intents via `IntentTextInputConnection`.

### Future Plans
- deprecate `TextInputClient` and `DeltaTextInputClient`.

[Eclipse's documentation](LINK confusingly recommends `.classpath` and `.project` being under version control. That recommendation makes sense if neither maven or gradle is used. 

However, when using either maven or gradle those files are generated each time based on the maven or gradle configuration - which causes issues when those files are version controlled. That is why I recommended ignoring these files _only_ if using maven or gradle, but _not_ for all Eclipse Java projects.

<LINK

This change helps the repo comply with [The Creative Commons Trademark
Policy][1]. [“The Creative Commons Trademark Policy applies to anyone
who uses the CC trademarks.”][2]

That policy says [“Our registered trademarks and other trademarks include
CREATIVE COMMONS (regardless of stylization, capitalization,
translation, or other presentation), CC (including the CC in a circle
logo (the “CC Logo”) and CC standing alone), CC+ (within a circle or
standing alone) and CCPlus, CC0, all of the Creative Commons license and
public domain buttons and icons, and any combination of the foregoing,
whether integrated into a larger whole or standing alone.”][1] This repo
uses the following trademarks from that list:

- CC and CC0 ([in `README.md`](LINK
- CREATIVE COMMONS, CC and CC0 (in [`LICENSE`](LINK

The Trademark Policy goes on to say [“To prevent confusion and maintain
consistency, you are not allowed to use CREATIVE COMMONS, CC, the CC
Logo, or any other Creative Commons trademarks with modified versions of
any of our legal tools or Commons deeds.”][1]

[CC0][3] [is a][4] [legal tool][5], so modified versions of CC0 can’t contain
Creative Commons trademarks.

Before this change, #2158 introduced a modified version of CC0. That
modified version still uses CC trademarks. That pull request’s original
post explains “The license for this repository isn't being detected
because the license file contain additional text, not part of the
license.” ([GitHub shouldn’t be detecting CC0 as a license at all, but
that’s a separate issue][6]). [GitHub now properly detects the official
plain text version of CC0][7], so the original motivation for the change
no longer applies.

1610,github/gitignore,kuritka,Adding AllowList for Go,"**Reasons for making this change:**

_Allowlisting with .gitignore is a technique for dealing with source trees that can have various different untracked local files such as generated output, packages installed through package managers, “working” files, config for individual developers, etc. Rather than trying to come up with some master list of all possible untracked files and add them to .gitignore, it can be easier to start by ignoring everything and then add specific directories back._

1611,github/gitignore,JP-Ellis,[Python] Add poetry.lock,"Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.  This is especially recommended for binary packages to ensure reproducibility, and is more commonly ignored for libraries.

**Reasons for making this change:**

This is very similar reasoning to the existing Pipenv entry and Poetry is quite popular too (17.4k stars on Github).  As the benefits/cons of including the lock file can vary for each project, the default is left commented out (just as the Pipenv entry).

This repo says that [its “license” is CC0](LINK CC0 is a public domain dedication, not a license. I use CC0 on some of my work, and have contributed to Creative Commons open source projects before. Part of my motivation for using CC0 is to prevent people from thinking about licensing. Copyright can get complicated quickly, and CC0 is a good way to eliminate that complication.

Here’s what I want to get from this change: I want people understand that copyright doesn’t really need to be a consideration when reusing CC0’d works.

The onus should be on anyone storing credentials in this file to manually add it to .gitignore.

first calling after is correct:

```

```

but second calling after, an error is beginning to occur:

```
<h1 data-line=""4"" class=""code-line"" id=""abc-1"">abc</h1>
```

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click the ""Open preview to the side"" button
2. Switch back to md
3. Click the ""Open preview to the side"" button again, and Click on the link titled ""abc"". The expected behavior is for the preview window to scroll down to the header titled ""abc"". It does not.

Tested by an extensions which calls:

1770,microsoft/vscode,aeschli,store remoteAuthority in backup or history,"With virtual workspaces (e.g. remote repositories) we can't tell from the workspace URI if the workspace is opened in a local or a remote window. Although we prefer that virtual workspaces are always opened in local windows, we need to make sure to pass along the 'remoteAuthority' when persisting or opening workspaces e.g. from backup or history

The PR fixes some gaps found
- store remoteAuthority with backup also for folders (it was already the case for workspaces and empty windows)
- always pass the remote authority to addRecentlyOpened
- when opening a window from the history, use the remoteAuthority  to decide whether a remote or local window is to be opened

The event of the configuration registry fire in my dev setup around 50 times. There is only 4 listeners to these events but assuming a listener takes 1ms it still makes 200ms (`50*4*1`) to fire them.

This PR adds a way to pause/resume eventing of the configuration registry and adopts that in the extension service when reading contribution points.

I measured the gains against todays insiders and things are looking pretty good. I have tested with only builtin extensions and with the 30 extensions that I have installed (using my data as real world representative, it is also pretty close to the real world average duration for this). The measurements are the times between the `willHandleExtensionPoints` and `didHandleExtensionPoints` perf-marks (F1 > Startup Performance)
